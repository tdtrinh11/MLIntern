285,1,1,1,"Marshall: Yeah, hate olives."
286,1,1,1,"Barney: Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?"
287,1,1,1,Marshall: (looks around for sign of Lily) You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.
288,1,1,1,Barney: I swear.
289,1,1,1,Ranjit: (Cuts into conversation) I swear.
290,1,1,1,"Marshall: On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, ""Sure... I hate olives."""

307,1,1,1,[Cut to the Cab]
308,1,1,1,"Barney: Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it."
309,1,1,1,"Marshall: Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women (Lily appears behind Marshall in the open window) doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl. (Lily pops her head in from the window. Marshall turns around) Lily. Lily, I like olives."

321,1,1,1,"Lily: Okay, eye patch gone-(takes eye patch off and throws it at Barney) And we can't just abandon Ted. If it doesn't go well up there he's gonna need some support."
322,1,1,1,Marshall: It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?
323,1,1,1,Barney: You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?
324,1,1,1,Marshall: Doggie style. (Laughs)

333,1,1,1,"Ted: (upset/tired) Thanks. (Walks down the steps. Robin begins to walk in) You know what? (Robin stops. Ted turns around). I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser."
334,1,1,1,Robin: Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
335,1,1,1,"Ted: Oh, I've got references."

379,2,1,2,"Narrator: Right, so (While Flashbacks take place) back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, ""Maybe I should get married."" Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in."
380,2,1,2,"Barney: I suggest we play a little game I like to call, ""Have you Met Ted?"""

393,2,1,2,"Ted: I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin. (Finds Lily and Robin chatting at a table.) Robin!"
394,2,1,2,Robin: Hey!
395,2,1,2,Lily: Look who I ran into!
396,2,1,2,Ted: Since when do you guys know each other?

402,2,1,2,Ted: I'm in love with her.
403,2,1,2,Barney: (hits him) No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.

421,2,1,2,"Robin: Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?"
422,2,1,2,Lily: Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.
423,2,1,2,[Flashback ends]
424,2,1,2,Lily: (shy) Oops...
425,2,1,2,"Ted: She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the ""happily ever after"" thing but you don't get there unless you play the game."
426,2,1,2,Marshall: So're you gonna ask her out?
427,2,1,2,"Ted: Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? (thinks)"

433,2,1,2,"Barney: Yeah, cuz nothing says ""Casual"" like inviting a hundred people over just to ""Mac"" on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg."
434,2,1,2,Lily: You waited five minutes to tell me that?
435,2,1,2,Marshall: Alright-so call her up!
436,2,1,2,"Ted: No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a ""chance"" encounter."

She says, ""Hey, nice place"" etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, ""Well make yourself at home,"" and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, ""Oh, you're still here?""

555,2,1,2,Ted: I have no idea who that is.
556,2,1,2,"Barney: She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?"
557,2,1,2,Ted: I don't know any Carlos.

565,2,1,2,"Ted: Oh, that was fast."
566,2,1,2,"Barney: Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?"
567,2,1,2,[Flashback]
568,2,1,2,Barney: I think I'm in love with you.
569,2,1,2,Tatiana: What?
570,2,1,2,[Flashback ends]
571,2,1,2,"Barney: Thanks, bro (walks away)"

576,2,1,2,Ted: Great! What am I going to do when Robin shows up. (Silence) She'll show up.
577,2,1,2,[Later after the party]
578,2,1,2,Narrator: She didn't show up.
579,2,1,2,"Marshall: Alright, we threw two parties. Everybody had fun. Everybody wanged, everybody chunged. Now the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed. Repeat after me, ""I will not have s*x with Marshall""."

587,2,1,2,Robin: (On Phone) I totally wanted to come; I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there. I'm sorry I missed your party...again.
588,2,1,2,"Ted: Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing mamacita. (To Lily and Marshall) WHO AM I?"
589,2,1,2,Robin: (On Phone) I guess there's no change your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer.
590,2,1,2,"Ted: (Silence) It did indeed, the party continues tonight. (Marshall grabs for him, Ted runs away) Yeah. Last night people were like, ""KEEP IT GOIN' BRO! PARTY TRIFECTA!"""

601,2,1,2,Lily: Hey little old books. Ready for a little fifteen minute recess?
602,2,1,2,"Marshall: Sorry, baby, I gotta work. I need all my blood (points to brain) up here. Has anybody seen an introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923? (Silence) Anybody seen a big-ass book?"
603,2,1,2,"Crowd: (mutters) No, no."
604,2,1,2,"Tatiana: Hello, Barney."
605,2,1,2,Barney: Of course.
606,2,1,2,Tatiana: You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?
607,2,1,2,Barney: Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!
608,2,1,2,"Tatiana: I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you."
609,2,1,2,Barney: Who is Carlos!?
610,2,1,2,"Marshall: Okay, where the hell is my-OHH! (Book has been used as coaster, all wet) Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up. (Ted's shocked) I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin? (Finds Robin) Hi! Hi Robin. (Throws book on the floor and grabs Lily for s*x)"
611,2,1,2,Robin: so you threw all these parties for me?
612,2,1,2,"Ted: No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I-(laughs)-one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh-(Barney throws Ted a random guy) this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it (nervously laughs)-Anyway Robin, this is."
613,2,1,2,Carlos: Carlos (shake hands)

619,2,1,2,"Lily: Okay, buddy, time for the ""tough-talk"". Robin seems great. But let's look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain't one of them."
620,2,1,2,"Ted: She's not just ""one of them"" she's the one."
621,2,1,2,"Barney: Yeah well, ""the one"" is heading up to ""the roof"". (Robin leaves to the roof with Carlos)"
622,2,1,2,Marshall: What are you gonna do?
623,2,1,2,"Ted: Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it."

629,2,1,2,"Ted: Robin, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that. (Robin smiles) I threw these parties because I wanted to see you."
630,2,1,2,"Robin: Well, here I am."
631,2,1,2,"Ted: There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy."
632,2,1,2,"Robin: (exhales) you're not crazy. I-I don't know, Ted, I mean we barely know each other and you're looking at me with that look and it's like-(struggles)"
633,2,1,2,Ted: Like what?
634,2,1,2,"Robin: like-let's fall in love, and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice."
635,2,1,2,Ted: I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.
636,2,1,2,Robin: (laughs) It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.
637,2,1,2,"Ted: No, I'm not."
638,2,1,2,"Robin: Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel."
639,2,1,2,Ted: (reaches in his Jacket) Click. Off. Let's make out.
640,2,1,2,Robin: (laughs) What?
641,2,1,2,"Ted: What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof."
642,2,1,2,Robin: There's no off switch.
643,2,1,2,Ted: There is an off switch... and it's off.
644,2,1,2,"Robin: (smiling) no, it's not."

646,2,1,2,Robin: No (smiles)...it's-not.
647,2,1,2,"Ted: Yes-it is (they kiss long) No it's not. You're right, there's no off switch. God I wish there was an off switch."
648,2,1,2,Robin: (sighs) me too.
649,2,1,2,(Silence. They laugh)
650,2,1,2,Ted: So (They mutter together. Then laugh)
651,2,1,2,Robin: we could be friends (shrugs)
652,2,1,2,Ted: Oh (clutches heart)
653,2,1,2,"Robin: look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but... we could."
654,2,1,2,"Ted: I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, ""Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass."""
655,2,1,2,Robin: You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand.
656,2,1,2,"Ted: Well-uh-maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh, we could all-uh...you know, get a beer."
657,2,1,2,"Robin: yeah. (sighs) That sounds good. I'll see you, Ted. (walks away)"

681,2,1,2,"Robin: You are a catch. You're gonna make some girl very happy, and I am going to help you find her."
682,2,1,2,"Ted: (laughs) Well, good luck. I mean maybe New York's just too big a town, you know? There's millions of people in this city. How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean, where do you even begin?"

1127,4,1,4,"Lily: Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone."
1128,4,1,4,"Marshall: Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person. (Lily Picks up her phone) It's the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling?"
1129,4,1,4,"Lily: (On Phone) Hi, Marshall, it's Lily. We're not going have s*x for at least a month. But you're awesome. Okay bye-bye. (Hangs up)"

1220,4,1,4,"Marshall: Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible."
1221,4,1,4,Lily: Why? What is so horrible about that?
1222,4,1,4,"Ted: Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...""She's not the one."" Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's ""The one"" are like six billion to one."

2140,7,1,7,"Ted: Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so..."
2141,7,1,7,"Ellen: How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK."

2156,7,1,7,Ted: What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?
2157,7,1,7,Ellen: 8.5.
2158,7,1,7,Ted: So he sucks.
2159,7,1,7,"Ellen: No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient."

2175,7,1,7,Marshall: And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.
2176,7,1,7,Lily: Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.
2177,7,1,7,"Marshall: For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know."
2178,7,1,7,"Robin: Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking."
2179,7,1,7,Marshall: So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?
2180,7,1,7,"Robin: Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster."
2181,7,1,7,"Marshall: If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster."

2185,7,1,7,Barney: You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.
2186,7,1,7,"Ted: All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?"

2267,7,1,7,Ted: Anything else?
2268,7,1,7,"Sarah: Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it."

2275,7,1,7,Ted: I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match.

2277,7,1,7,Ted (singing): Summer breeze...
2278,7,1,7,Sarah: Ted.
2279,7,1,7,"Ted: Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?"
2280,7,1,7,Sarah: Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?
2281,7,1,7,"Ted: See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other."
2282,7,1,7,"Sarah: Ted, just calm down."
2283,7,1,7,Ted: Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.
2284,7,1,7,"Sarah: Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so."
2285,7,1,7,"Ted: Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused."
2286,7,1,7,"Sarah: Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10."

3340,10,1,10,"Barney: Don't worry, I slept through it. (laughs) I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank."

3521,10,1,10,"Trudy: So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed."
3522,10,1,10,"Marshall: Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry."
3523,10,1,10,(knock on door)
3524,10,1,10,"Ted: Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom."
3525,10,1,10,(Ted grabs Trudy's hand and drags her to his room)
3526,10,1,10,"Trudy: Why, is that your girlfriend?"
3527,10,1,10,"Ted: No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated."
3528,10,1,10,"Trudy: You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this."
3529,10,1,10,"Ted: No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide."
3530,10,1,10,"(Trudy goes into Ted's room, Ted goes over and opens front door)"
3531,10,1,10,Ted: Hi.
3532,10,1,10,Robin: Hey guys.
3533,10,1,10,Barney: Robin.
3534,10,1,10,Lily: Hi Robin.
3535,10,1,10,Barney: Top of the morning.
3536,10,1,10,"Ted: Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk."
3537,10,1,10,"Robin: No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk."
3538,10,1,10,Lily: Let's go get a snack.
3539,10,1,10,(Lily stands up)
3540,10,1,10,Marshall: I love to snack.
3541,10,1,10,(Marshall stands up)
3542,10,1,10,Barney: I'm good.
3543,10,1,10,"(Lily pulls Barney up, Marshall, Lily and Barney walk over to kitchen)"
3544,10,1,10,"Ted: Come on, those calls weren't that weird."
3545,10,1,10,"(Robin clears her throat, gets her phone out of her purse, presses button and phone replays Ted's call to Robin)"
3546,10,1,10,"Ted: (recording form phone) Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out."
3547,10,1,10,(Ted makes weird sound)
3548,10,1,10,Robin: That goes on for three-and a half minutes.
3549,10,1,10,Ted: Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.
3550,10,1,10,"Robin: Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing."
3551,10,1,10,"Ted: No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on."
3552,10,1,10,"Robin: Really, you moved on?"
3553,10,1,10,"Ted: Yes. What, you don't believe me?"
3554,10,1,10,(Robin exhales)
3555,10,1,10,"Ted: Oh, OK."
3556,10,1,10,(Ted limps over to his room)
3557,10,1,10,"Ted: Trudy, come on out."
3558,10,1,10,(Ted points to Robin) Ted: You are gonna laugh.
3559,10,1,10,"Robin: Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool."
3560,10,1,10,(Ted knocks on his bedroom door)
3561,10,1,10,"Ted: Trudy, come on out."
3562,10,1,10,(Robin walks over to Ted)
3563,10,1,10,"Ted: Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think."

3568,10,1,10,"Robin: Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy."
3569,10,1,10,Ted: I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.
3570,10,1,10,(Robin looks at Ted incredulously)
3571,10,1,10,"Ted: Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think."
3572,10,1,10,"Robin: Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?"
3573,10,1,10,"Robin: Yes, you did, last night."
3574,10,1,10,Ted: Really? Well.
3575,10,1,10,"Robin: Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse."
3576,10,1,10,"(Robin walks out of his room, Ted sits down on bed and lies back)"
3577,10,1,10,"Future Ted VO: I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle."

3581,10,1,10,"Future Ted VO: Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious."
3582,11,1,11,"Ted from 2030: Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks. Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve. I had an idea of how to do it, too. And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus."
3583,11,1,11,"Ted: Yeah, that's right...a limo."
3584,11,1,11,[3 hours before midnight]
3585,11,1,11,"Robin: Oh, man, Ted, this is great."
3586,11,1,11,"Ted: Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five."
3587,11,1,11,Barney: Question?
3588,11,1,11,"Ted: Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants."
3589,11,1,11,"Barney: But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants."
3590,11,1,11,Lily: Yeah.
3591,11,1,11,"Ted: We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year."
3592,11,1,11,"Lily: All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?"
3593,11,1,11,Robin: Mary Beth?
3594,11,1,11,"Ted: Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight..."
3595,11,1,11,"Barney: People often ask me ""Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"""
3596,11,1,11,Lily: By who? Who asks you that?
3597,11,1,11,"Barney: And the answer is right here... my own, personal ""get psyched"" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam."
3598,11,1,11,Lily: It's working.
3599,11,1,11,Ted: I am definitely getting psyched.
3600,11,1,11,"Marshall: Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot."
3601,11,1,11,Barney: Let's do this!
3602,11,1,11,"Ted: Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?"
3603,11,1,11,"Barney: Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome."
3604,11,1,11,Ranjit: I've moved up in the world.
3605,11,1,11,Robin: How do you guys know each other?
3606,11,1,11,"Ted: Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story."
3607,11,1,11,"Barney: Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it."
3608,11,1,11,"Robin: Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up."
3609,11,1,11,"Ted from 2030: Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek. Derek. He was like rich, successful, handsome. I hated that guy."
3610,11,1,11,"Robin: Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun."
3611,11,1,11,Lily: Bye.
3612,11,1,11,Ted: See ya next year. Go get 'em.
3613,11,1,11,"Lily: Well, this kind of sucks."
3614,11,1,11,"Ted: Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one."
3615,11,1,11,Ranjit: Party number one!
3616,11,1,11,Barney: Party number one!
3617,11,1,11,[2H30 before midnight]
3618,11,1,11,"Marshall: I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones."
3619,11,1,11,"Ted: Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it."
3620,11,1,11,"Lily: We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall."
3621,11,1,11,Mary Beth: Hi. Mary Beth. So great to meet you guys.
3622,11,1,11,Marshall: My word.
3623,11,1,11,"Lily: You're, you're friendly."
3624,11,1,11,Mary Beth: American party friends of Barney's.
3625,11,1,11,"Lily: Oh, no."
3626,11,1,11,"Ted: So, Barney, who's your new friend?"
3627,11,1,11,Barney: Natalya.
3628,11,1,11,"Natalya: Oh, friendly."
3629,11,1,11,"Lily: So, where are you from, Natalya?"
3630,11,1,11,Barney: She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
3631,11,1,11,"Natalya: Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?"
3632,11,1,11,Barney: Isn't she awesome?
3633,11,1,11,"Marshall: How are your feet doing, baby?"
3634,11,1,11,"Lily: Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?"
3635,11,1,11,"Ted: Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain."
3636,11,1,11,"Lily: Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking."
3637,11,1,11,"Barney: It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?"
3638,11,1,11,Ted: Ranjit! Party number two.
3639,11,1,11,Ranjit: Party number two.
3640,11,1,11,[1h55 before midnight]
3641,11,1,11,Ted: Party number two? Not so good.
3642,11,1,11,Marshall: Let's go back to party number one.
3643,11,1,11,"Ted: No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three."
3644,11,1,11,Ranjit: Party number three. Yeah.
3645,11,1,11,"Barney: Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya."
3646,11,1,11,"Lily: Barney, none of us really liked her."
3647,11,1,11,Barney: What?!
3648,11,1,11,Lily: Sorry.
3649,11,1,11,"Barney: Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?"
3650,11,1,11,Ted: I'm sorry about Barney.
3651,11,1,11,"Mary Beth: No, I'm having a great time. I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight."
3652,11,1,11,"Ted: Me, too. (Ted's phone starts ringing) Hey, Robin."
3653,11,1,11,"Robin: Ted, Derek stood me up."
3654,11,1,11,"Ted from 2030: Pfft. Derek. Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl. But... it was Robin."
3655,11,1,11,"Ted: Ranjit, turn it around."
3656,11,1,11,[1h38 before midnight]
3657,11,1,11,"Robin: Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up."
3658,11,1,11,"Ted: No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together."
3659,11,1,11,Lily: What happened?
3660,11,1,11,Robin: Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.
3661,11,1,11,(Barney puts the music on)
3662,11,1,11,"Marshall: Oh, dude, not now!"
3663,11,1,11,Barney: What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.
3664,11,1,11,(Barney stops the music)
3665,11,1,11,Robin: Maybe I should just go home.
3666,11,1,11,(Barney puts the music back on)
3667,11,1,11,Barney: My finger slipped.
3668,11,1,11,(He stops the music one more time)
3669,11,1,11,"Ted: Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight."
3670,11,1,11,"Robin: Hi, I'm Robin."
3671,11,1,11,Mary Beth: Mary Beth.
3672,11,1,11,Robin: You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?
3673,11,1,11,"Ted: That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!"
3674,11,1,11,"Robin: Oh, yes. Ted, you rock."
3675,11,1,11,"Barney: We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?"
3676,11,1,11,"Marshall: Yeah, we like hot dogs."
3677,11,1,11,"Barney: No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit."
3678,11,1,11,Ranjit: You don't know what you're missing.
3679,11,1,11,"Ted: Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour."
3680,11,1,11,"Lily: Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car."
3681,11,1,11,Ranjit: Stopping the car.
3682,11,1,11,"Marshall: Wait. Baby, what are you doing?"
3683,11,1,11,Lily: I'm going home.
3684,11,1,11,Ted: What? No!
3685,11,1,11,"Lily: I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes."
3686,11,1,11,Marshall: But... hot dogs.
3687,11,1,11,"Lily: Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one."
3688,11,1,11,"Marshall: Okay, I'll go with you."
3689,11,1,11,"Lily: No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three."
3690,11,1,11,Marshall: Are you sure?
3691,11,1,11,"Lily: If I don't see you, happy new year."
3692,11,1,11,Marshall: Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other.
3693,11,1,11,Lily: I know we will. (Lily leaves the limo)
3694,11,1,11,Marshall: Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs!
3695,11,1,11,[1h18 before midnight]
3696,11,1,11,"Ted: Ranjit, party number three."
3697,11,1,11,Ranjit: Party number three.
3698,11,1,11,"Marshall: Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president."
3699,11,1,11,Ted: Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.
3700,11,1,11,"Robin: Oh, so much better."
3701,11,1,11,Marshall: Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby.
3702,11,1,11,"Ted from 2030: Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young."
3703,11,1,11,Ted: No way.
3704,11,1,11,Robin: That's totally Moby. That's awesome.
3705,11,1,11,"Ted: Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!"
3706,11,1,11,"Barney: Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool."
3707,11,1,11,Ted: Hey.
3708,11,1,11,Moby: Hello.
3709,11,1,11,"Ted: What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?"
3710,11,1,11,"Moby: Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown."
3711,11,1,11,Ted: You want a ride?
3712,11,1,11,Moby: Sure.
3713,11,1,11,Ted: Welcome.
3714,11,1,11,Moby: Wow. You're friendly.
3715,11,1,11,"Barney: Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?"
3716,11,1,11,"Moby: It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends."
3717,11,1,11,"Robin: Wow, that sounds awesome."
3718,11,1,11,Moby: You guys want to come?
3719,11,1,11,"Ted: Yeah, we'd love to."
3720,11,1,11,Moby: All right.
3721,11,1,11,"Marshall: Uh, Ted. Sidebar?"
3722,11,1,11,"Ted: Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up?"
3723,11,1,11,Marshall: What about Lily?
3724,11,1,11,Ted: Call her.
3725,11,1,11,Marshall: I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed.
3726,11,1,11,"Ted: That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards..."
3727,11,1,11,"Marshall: No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three."
3728,11,1,11,Ted: But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party.
3729,11,1,11,Ranjit: Moby's party.
3730,11,1,11,"Moby: This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise."
3731,11,1,11,"Barney: Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it."
3732,11,1,11,"Moby: Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here."
3733,11,1,11,Barney: Jan... Aah!
3734,11,1,11,"Moby: So then I say, ""your motorcycle was like that when I got here."""
3735,11,1,11,"Ted: You're not Moby, are you?"
3736,11,1,11,Moby: Who?
3737,11,1,11,"Robin: Moby... the recording artist, Moby."
3738,11,1,11,Moby: No.
3739,11,1,11,"Barney: But when we said, ""Hey, Moby,"" you said, ""Yeah."""
3740,11,1,11,"Not-Moby: I thought you said ""Tony."""
3741,11,1,11,Ted: So your name is Tony?
3742,11,1,11,"Not-Moby: No. Oh, hey, we're here. All right. You guys going to come in?"
3743,11,1,11,Ted: Nah.
3744,11,1,11,Not-Moby: You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.
3745,11,1,11,"Barney: No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby."
3746,11,1,11,"Not-Moby: Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe."
3747,11,1,11,Barney: Why did we think that guy was Moby?
3748,11,1,11,"Ted: I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby."
3749,11,1,11,Barney: That's Marshall's phone. Hello.
3750,11,1,11,"Lily: Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through."
3751,11,1,11,"Barney: Hey, sexy."
3752,11,1,11,"Lily: Barney, where's Marshall?"
3753,11,1,11,Barney: He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.
3754,11,1,11,Lily: What? Where?
3755,11,1,11,Barney: Party number three.
3756,11,1,11,"Lily: Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!"
3757,11,1,11,Barney: Moby?! She's upstairs.
3758,11,1,11,"Ted: Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby."
3759,11,1,11,"Lily: Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a gun?"
3760,11,1,11,"Ted: Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?"
3761,11,1,11,(Lily comes in)
3762,11,1,11,Lily: Who was that guy?!
3763,11,1,11,"Barney: Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony."
3764,11,1,11,"Ted: Ranjit, drive!"
3765,11,1,11,Ranjit: Where to?
3766,11,1,11,Ted: Party number three!
3767,11,1,11,Ranjit: Party number three!
3768,11,1,11,"Lily: No, but I was just at party number three."
3769,11,1,11,"Ted: No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong."
3770,11,1,11,"Barney: Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my ""Get Psyched"" mix!"
3771,11,1,11,"Ted: Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule."
3772,11,1,11,"Ranjit: Ah, nuts."
3773,11,1,11,

3825,11,1,11,"Marshall: Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on."

3827,11,1,11,"Lily: Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?"
3828,11,1,11,"Marshall: I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there."

4280,13,1,13,Ted: Go ahead.
4281,13,1,13,"Victoria: OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out."
4282,13,1,13,Ted: What are you saying?
4283,13,1,13,"Victoria: I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again."
4284,13,1,13,Ted: Unless...
4285,13,1,13,"Victoria: No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect."
4286,13,1,13,"Ted: Wow. OK, I'm in."
4287,13,1,13,Victoria: OK.
4288,13,1,13,"Ted: I guess, what, we'll need fake names?"
4289,13,1,13,"Victoria: Um, you can call me Buttercup."

4303,13,1,13,"Marshall: Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea."
4304,13,1,13,"Ted: No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it."
4305,13,1,13,"Marshall: Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake."
4306,13,1,13,"Ted: That cake really got to you, huh?"
4307,13,1,13,Marshall: It haunts me.

4310,13,1,13,Ted: Mm-hm.
4311,13,1,13,Victoria: Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.
4312,13,1,13,(Ted gets up and grabs a bottle of champagne and two glasses and comes back over to Victoria and grabs her hand and leads her out of the reception area)

4314,13,1,13,(Ted and Victoria slow down and stop by the cake table)
4315,13,1,13,Victoria: Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.
4316,13,1,13,"Ted: Yes, but we'll need a diversion."
4317,13,1,13,(Ted grabs utensil from table and starts clinking his glass with it)
4318,13,1,13,Ted: Kiss.

4322,13,1,13,"Lily: So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition."
4323,13,1,13,Ted: You're not gonna do it at your wedding?
4324,13,1,13,"Lily: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do."
4325,13,1,13,"Marshall: So, where did you guys go?"

4333,13,1,13,"Ted: Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight."
4334,13,1,13,"Victoria: Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some."
4335,13,1,13,Ted: No you couldn't.
4336,13,1,13,Victoria: You're a dude. I could totally...
4337,13,1,13,Ted: Totally get some.
4338,13,1,13,"(Ted and Victoria look at each other, Ted starts to lean in towards Victoria)"
4339,13,1,13,Victoria: We're not gonna kiss tonight.
4340,13,1,13,(Ted pounds keys on piano)
4341,13,1,13,"Victoria: If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken."
4342,13,1,13,Ted: I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.
4343,13,1,13,"Victoria: OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll."
4344,13,1,13,Ted: OK.
4345,13,1,13,Victoria: But we can't kiss.
4346,13,1,13,Ted: OK.

4351,13,1,13,"Ted: She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again."

4357,13,1,13,"Lily: Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then."

4387,13,1,13,"Marshall: Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay."
4388,13,1,13,Ted: Marshall. She was not a ghost.
4389,13,1,13,"Marshall: I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form."
4390,13,1,13,"Ted: Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?"

4537,13,1,13,"(Ted turns to leave, Barney gets up also)"
4538,13,1,13,"Barney: Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!"
4539,13,1,13,Ted: Yes! No.
4540,13,1,13,Barney: Oh come on!
4541,13,1,13,(flashback to Ted and Victoria returning to reception hall to find everyone has left)
4542,13,1,13,Ted: Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.
4543,13,1,13,"Victoria: Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance."
4544,13,1,13,"(Ted sees little boom box on table and turns it on, Ted and Victoria begin to dance)"
4545,13,1,13,"Ted: Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking."
4546,13,1,13,"Victoria: Wow, what was I thinking?"
4547,13,1,13,"Ted: Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux."
4548,13,1,13,"Victoria: You got me, you are good."
4549,13,1,13,"Ted: You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it."
4550,13,1,13,Victoria: The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.
4551,13,1,13,(back to present scene)
4552,13,1,13,INT. CAB
4553,13,1,13,"(Ted sitting up front in sweatshirt, Barney, Lily and Marshall sit in back of cab)"
4554,13,1,13,Lily: Buttercup Bakery. This is it.
4555,13,1,13,"Marshall: Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake."
4556,13,1,13,"Barney: Ted, you still with us?"
4557,13,1,13,"(flashback to Ted and Victoria dancing, they lean in to kiss but pull away)"
4558,13,1,13,Ted: Tell me your last name.
4559,13,1,13,(Victoria shakes her head)
4560,13,1,13,"Ted: You know, there's one little flaw in our plan."
4561,13,1,13,Victoria: What's that?
4562,13,1,13,Ted: I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.
4563,13,1,13,(Victoria pulls away from Ted)
4564,13,1,13,"Victoria: Hey, Ted."
4565,13,1,13,Ted: Yeah?
4566,13,1,13,"Victoria: Close your eyes, and count to five."
4567,13,1,13,(Ted closes his eyes)
4568,13,1,13,"Ted: One, two, three, four, five."
4569,13,1,13,(Ted opens his eyes to find Victoria gone)
4570,13,1,13,(back to present scene)
4571,13,1,13,"Ted: And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be..."
4572,13,1,13,"Barney: The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot."
4573,13,1,13,Ted: OK.
4574,13,1,13,(Ted gets out of cab)
4575,13,1,13,INT. BUTTERCUP BAKERY
4576,13,1,13,"(Ted stands outside bakery looking in to see Victoria icing a cupcake, Ted enters bakery, bell on door tinkles, Victoria turns her head to see Ted standing there)"
4577,13,1,13,Victoria: Oh thank God.
4578,13,1,13,(Victoria rushes towards Ted and they kiss)
4579,14,1,14,"Ted from 2030: When you meet someone special, suddenly life is full of firsts. The first kiss. The first night together. The first weekend together. For me, all those firsts happened within 48 hours of meeting Victoria."
4580,14,1,14,The appartment
4581,14,1,14,"Marshall: They have to come out soon, it's Monday."
4582,14,1,14,Lily: Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.
4583,14,1,14,Marshall: Maybe they're not even in there.
4584,14,1,14,(The door of Ted's room opens and Marshall Lily runs away from it)
4585,14,1,14,Victoria: Good morning.
4586,14,1,14,"Ted: Hey, guys."
4587,14,1,14,Victoria: I'm just going to ignore that.
4588,14,1,14,Marshall: Thank you!
4589,14,1,14,Ted: I wish you could stay.
4590,14,1,14,"Victoria: I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting."
4591,14,1,14,Ted: Call you afterwards?
4592,14,1,14,Victoria: I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.
4593,14,1,14,Ted: Bye.
4594,14,1,14,Marshall: Two days straight?!
4595,14,1,14,"Lily: Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!"
4596,14,1,14,"Marshall: Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits."
4597,14,1,14,Ted: Zero.
4598,14,1,14,Marshall: What?
4599,14,1,14,Lily: What?
4600,14,1,14,"Ted: Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow."
4601,14,1,14,Marshall: Her idea.
4602,14,1,14,"Ted: Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on."
4603,14,1,14,[3 weeks later]
4604,14,1,14,The Bar
4605,14,1,14,Ted: I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.
4606,14,1,14,Marshall: I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.
4607,14,1,14,Ted: You've only had s*x with one girl in your whole life.
4608,14,1,14,Lily: Burn!
4609,14,1,14,"Barney: Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old."
4610,14,1,14,Robin: Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?
4611,14,1,14,"Ted: Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner."
4612,14,1,14,"Lily: No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary."
4613,14,1,14,"Robin: Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats."
4614,14,1,14,Lily: Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.
4615,14,1,14,"Marshall: It's one of New York Magazine's ""Top five romantic getaways on a budget."" Who says sexual can't be sensible?"
4616,14,1,14,"Robin: Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me."
4617,14,1,14,Barney: Really?
4618,14,1,14,"Robin: Actually, I was talking to my martini."
4619,14,1,14,The appartment
4620,14,1,14,Marshall: Ready to go?
4621,14,1,14,"Lily: Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast."
4622,14,1,14,Marshall: Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp.
4623,14,1,14,Lily: Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.
4624,14,1,14,Marshall: Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.
4625,14,1,14,"Lily: Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive."
4626,14,1,14,Marshall: And it's supposed to rain tonight.
4627,14,1,14,Lily: Or we could just stay home.
4628,14,1,14,Marshall: Maybe watch some TV.
4629,14,1,14,Lily: Order in some Chinese.
4630,14,1,14,"Marshall: Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?"
4631,14,1,14,"Lily: Hell, yeah."
4632,14,1,14,"Marshall: Good, cause this thing's empty."
4633,14,1,14,The Bar
4634,14,1,14,"Barney: Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say ""wow."""
4635,14,1,14,"Robin: Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident."
4636,14,1,14,Barney: It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.
4637,14,1,14,Robin: Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?
4638,14,1,14,Barney: You can't just... Wow!
4639,14,1,14,Robin: Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.
4640,14,1,14,"Barney: Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a ""bro"" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?"
4641,14,1,14,"Robin: Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in."
4642,14,1,14,In a cab
4643,14,1,14,Victoria: So... one more week and it'll be a month.
4644,14,1,14,"Ted: Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me."
4645,14,1,14,"Victoria: Oh, come on."
4646,14,1,14,Ted: The 18th can't get here fast enough.
4647,14,1,14,"Victoria: Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!"
4648,14,1,14,"Ted: Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this."
4649,14,1,14,Victoria: Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.
4650,14,1,14,Ted: 75th and Amsterdam.
4651,14,1,14,In the bathroom
4652,14,1,14,Lily: I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.
4653,14,1,14,"Marshall: Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky."
4654,14,1,14,Lily: And yet we'd feel obligated to have s*x.
4655,14,1,14,"Marshall: Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever."
4656,14,1,14,"(Ted and Victoria enters the appartment, kissing)"
4657,14,1,14,Ted: I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.
4658,14,1,14,Victoria: I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.
4659,14,1,14,"Lily: Oh, my God, what are they doing home?"
4660,14,1,14,"Marshall: They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted."
4661,14,1,14,"Lily: But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom."
4662,14,1,14,Marshall: They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.
4663,14,1,14,Lily: But I don't want to hide out in here.
4664,14,1,14,"Marshall: Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have s*x with Ted, and... not going to be me."
4665,14,1,14,"Lily: Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss."
4666,14,1,14,In a bar
4667,14,1,14,Barney: You suited up!
4668,14,1,14,"Robin: Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right."
4669,14,1,14,Barney: Emilio? The woman will have...
4670,14,1,14,"Robin: I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks."
4671,14,1,14,"Barney: Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. ""The Torpedo."" Or, as the rollers call it, ""Piramide."""
4672,14,1,14,"Robin: My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention."
4673,14,1,14,Barney: Father issues. Hot.
4674,14,1,14,Robin: I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.
4675,14,1,14,"Barney: Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl."
4676,14,1,14,"Robin: Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant."
4677,14,1,14,Barney: What up! Freeze frame high five!
4678,14,1,14,The appartment
4679,14,1,14,Victoria: I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.
4680,14,1,14,"Ted: No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious."
4681,14,1,14,"(In the bathroom, Lily and Marshall are ears dropping...)"
4682,14,1,14,"Lily: Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad."
4683,14,1,14,Marshall: And they're not even high.
4684,14,1,14,Lily: It's actually working.
4685,14,1,14,"Marshall: Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had s*x three times by now."
4686,14,1,14,"Lily: Yeah, try five."
4687,14,1,14,Marshall: What up! Maybe we should just go out there.
4688,14,1,14,Lily: No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.
4689,14,1,14,Marshall: Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.
4690,14,1,14,(Marshall opens the door)
4691,14,1,14,"Victoria: I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?"
4692,14,1,14,"Lily: Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl."
4693,14,1,14,In a bar
4694,14,1,14,Robin: So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?
4695,14,1,14,Barney: Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...
4696,14,1,14,Robin: What?
4697,14,1,14,Barney: There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.
4698,14,1,14,At Laser-Tag
4699,14,1,14,"Robin: Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!"
4700,14,1,14,"Barney: Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months."
4701,14,1,14,"Robin: Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!"
4702,14,1,14,"Barney: Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?"
4703,14,1,14,Robin: Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.
4704,14,1,14,The appartment
4705,14,1,14,Marshall: He's just staring into her eyes.
4706,14,1,14,"Lily: I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us."
4707,14,1,14,Marshall: Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.
4708,14,1,14,"Lily: No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom."
4709,14,1,14,"Marshall: Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time."
4710,14,1,14,"Lily: Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, ""Want to do it?"" And I say, ""Yeah."""
4711,14,1,14,Marshall: Want to...
4712,14,1,14,Lily: No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.
4713,14,1,14,Marshall: Looks like they're about to have theirs.
4714,14,1,14,Ted: Should we take this to the bedroom?
4715,14,1,14,Marshall: Yes!
4716,14,1,14,Lily: Yes!
4717,14,1,14,Victoria: Yes.
4718,14,1,14,Marshall: Yes!
4719,14,1,14,Lily: Yes!
4720,14,1,14,(Ted's phone starts ringing)
4721,14,1,14,"Marshall: No. No, don't answer it!"
4722,14,1,14,Victoria: You can answer it. We have all night.
4723,14,1,14,Marshall: You're answering it? He's answering it!
4724,14,1,14,Lily: No! Do her! Do her now!
4725,14,1,14,Ted: Sure. Good luck with that. (He hangs up) Sorry about that.
4726,14,1,14,Victoria: How about a little more wine?
4727,14,1,14,Ted: I'll get another bottle.
4728,14,1,14,Lily: I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?
4729,14,1,14,Marshall: Shh...
4730,14,1,14,
4731,14,1,14,At Laser-Tag
4732,14,1,14,"Robin: Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it."
4733,14,1,14,Barney: No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.
4734,14,1,14,Robin: But I...
4735,14,1,14,"Barney: Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky."
4736,14,1,14,Robin: See you on the other side.
4737,14,1,14,Barney: Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?
4738,14,1,14,Robin: Yeah.
4739,14,1,14,Barney: All right.
4740,14,1,14,The appartment
4741,14,1,14,"Lily: Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?"
4742,14,1,14,"Marshall: Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes."
4743,14,1,14,"Lily: Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it."
4744,14,1,14,Marshall: It's all right. We can do this.
4745,14,1,14,Lily: Let's just hold hands. This is nice.
4746,14,1,14,Marshall: You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.
4747,14,1,14,"Lily: All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here."
4748,14,1,14,"Marshall: Well, we can't."
4749,14,1,14,"Lily: Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship."
4750,14,1,14,Marshall: What is it?
4751,14,1,14,Lily: I have to pee.
4752,14,1,14,Marshall: This is bad.
4753,14,1,14,Lily: Yeah.
4754,14,1,14,Marshall: We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.
4755,14,1,14,"Lily: Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever."
4756,14,1,14,Marshall: How much longer do you think you can hold it?
4757,14,1,14,Lily: I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.
4758,14,1,14,"Marshall: Oh, boy."
4759,14,1,14,The Bar
4760,14,1,14,Robin: Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.
4761,14,1,14,Barney: Neither have I. Of course I cheat.
4762,14,1,14,"Robin: Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L."
4763,14,1,14,Barney: Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.
4764,14,1,14,"Robin: Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox."
4765,14,1,14,"Barney: Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt."
4766,14,1,14,Robin: That's a woman.
4767,14,1,14,"Barney: Oh, my mistake. Or is it?"
4768,14,1,14,Robin: Let's just focus on your target.
4769,14,1,14,Barney: Right.
4770,14,1,14,"Robin: Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans."
4771,14,1,14,Woman: Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...
4772,14,1,14,"Robin: Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get."
4773,14,1,14,Woman: Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.
4774,14,1,14,"Robin: Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him."
4775,14,1,14,Woman: We'll see about that.
4776,14,1,14,The appartment
4777,14,1,14,"Lily: Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much."
4778,14,1,14,"Marshall: Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other."
4779,14,1,14,"Lily: No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive."
4780,14,1,14,"Marshall: Well, you have farted in front of me."
4781,14,1,14,"Lily: Yes, but I always cover it with a cough."
4782,14,1,14,Marshall: You always do.
4783,14,1,14,The Bar
4784,14,1,14,Barney: Hey.
4785,14,1,14,Robin: Hey.
4786,14,1,14,Barney: Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.
4787,14,1,14,Robin: What happened?
4788,14,1,14,"Barney: Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release."
4789,14,1,14,Robin: But why?
4790,14,1,14,Barney: Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.
4791,14,1,14,"Robin: Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?"
4792,14,1,14,Barney: Hit!
4793,14,1,14,The appartment
4794,14,1,14,"Victoria: Ted, I can't wait any longer."
4795,14,1,14,Ted: Should we move to the bedroom?
4796,14,1,14,Victoria: There's no time for that.
4797,14,1,14,"Marshall: They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?"
4798,14,1,14,"Lily: Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time."
4799,14,1,14,Marshall: I know.
4800,14,1,14,"Lily: I love you, Marshall."
4801,14,1,14,"Marshall: I love you, Lily."
4802,14,1,14,In front of Robin's appartment
4803,14,1,14,"You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly good time bro-ing out tonight."
4804,14,1,14,"Barney: Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake."
4805,14,1,14,"Robin: Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys."
4806,14,1,14,Barney: Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (Barney strips down)
4807,14,1,14,Robin: I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?
4808,14,1,14,"Barney: I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?"
4809,14,1,14,Robin: No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.
4810,14,1,14,"Barney: Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night."
4811,14,1,14,Robin: What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.
4812,14,1,14,"Barney: You invited me up to your apartment to ""play Battleship."" Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?"
4813,14,1,14,Robin: No.
4814,14,1,14,Barney: Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.
4815,14,1,14,The appartment
4816,14,1,14,Lily: I'm okay. You okay?
4817,14,1,14,"Marshall: I feel the same. And yet, strangely different."
4818,14,1,14,"Lily: I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us."
4819,14,1,14,"Marshall: You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes."
4820,14,1,14,"Lily: Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!"
4821,14,1,14,Marshall: They must have heard that.
4822,14,1,14,"Lily: Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone."
4823,14,1,14,Marshall: Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.
4824,14,1,14,At Robin's
4825,14,1,14,"Robin: Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second..."
4826,14,1,14,"Barney: But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well."
4827,14,1,14,"Robin: Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?"
4828,14,1,14,Barney: I checked with Ted.
4829,14,1,14,[FLASHBACK]
4830,14,1,14,"Barney: Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?"
4831,14,1,14,Ted: Sure. Good luck with that.
4832,14,1,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
4833,14,1,14,Barney: Totally gave us his blessing.
4834,14,1,14,Robin: Really?
4835,14,1,14,Barney: Really.
4836,14,1,14,Robin: So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?
4837,14,1,14,Barney: Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...
4838,14,1,14,Robin: What?
4839,14,1,14,Barney: You like Ted.
4840,14,1,14,Robin: I didn't say I liked Ted.
4841,14,1,14,Barney: You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.
4842,14,1,14,"Robin: Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for..."
4843,14,1,14,"Barney: Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?"
4844,14,1,14,"Robin: You're not gonna tell him, are you?"
4845,14,1,14,Barney: No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.
4846,14,1,14,Robin: A-7.
4847,14,1,14,Barney: Miss.
4848,14,1,14,Robin: Of course.
4849,14,1,14,The appartment
4850,14,1,14,"Marshall: Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce."
4851,14,1,14,Lily: Not making me feel better.
4852,14,1,14,"Marshall: Well, it certainly was a first."
4853,14,1,14,"Lily: It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts."
4854,14,1,14,"Marshall: Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul."
4855,14,1,14,"Lily: Marshall, what makes you cry?"
4856,14,1,14,Marshall: This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.
4857,14,1,14,"Lily: Oh, just grab my boob already."
4858,14,1,14,(Ted comes out of his room)
4859,14,1,14,"Ted: Come on, guys, get a room."
4860,15,1,15,"Ted from 2030: Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall is that he's always been good at games. I mean, unbeatable. Gin! Yahtzee! Poker!"
4861,15,1,15,"Ted: You don't have to shout out ""poker"" when you win."
4862,15,1,15,Marshall: I know. It's just fun to say.
4863,15,1,15,"Ted from 2030: We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, ""invent your own game."""
4864,15,1,15,The Bar
4865,15,1,15,"Marshall: It's called ""Marsh-gammon."" It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary."
4866,15,1,15,"Robin: Backgammon, obviously."
4867,15,1,15,"Marshall: No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the ""gammon,"" and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs."
4868,15,1,15,Lily: I'm so excited Victoria's coming.
4869,15,1,15,Robin: I'm going to go get another round.
4870,15,1,15,"Ted: Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the..."
4871,15,1,15,"Barney: Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return."
4872,15,1,15,Ted: No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.
4873,15,1,15,"Lily: Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?"
4874,15,1,15,"Ted: Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?"
4875,15,1,15,Lily: Us? What would we do?
4876,15,1,15,"Ted: Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?"
4877,15,1,15,Marshall: Fine.
4878,15,1,15,Lily: Fine.
4879,15,1,15,Ted: Thank you.
4880,15,1,15,Lily: I should go help Robin.
4881,15,1,15,Robin: Hey.
4882,15,1,15,"Lily: Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?"
4883,15,1,15,"Robin: Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, ""She's great"" too many times, didn't I?"
4884,15,1,15,Lily: You must really hate the bitch.
4885,15,1,15,The appartment
4886,15,1,15,"Marshall: But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you ""Marshall out,"" and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question ""What?"", then... you got to drink. Got it?"
4887,15,1,15,All: No
4888,15,1,15,"Marshall: Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll."
4889,15,1,15,Victoria: Okay.
4890,15,1,15,"Marshall: Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on."
4891,15,1,15,"Ted: Marshall, come on."
4892,15,1,15,"Marshall: Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, ""Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"" Wow, good question."
4893,15,1,15,Ted: You don't have to answer that.
4894,15,1,15,"Victoria: It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up."
4895,15,1,15,"Marshall: Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains."
4896,15,1,15,"Barney: So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?"
4897,15,1,15,Victoria: What?
4898,15,1,15,"Marshall: You said what, you got to drink!"
4899,15,1,15,"Lily: Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?"
4900,15,1,15,"Barney: Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon."
4901,15,1,15,"Lily: Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give..."
4902,15,1,15,Barney: Where's the tape?
4903,15,1,15,Lily: Fine. I'll go get it.
4904,15,1,15,"Barney: Cool, okay. You know, whenever."
4905,15,1,15,"Marshall: Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!"
4906,15,1,15,Ted: Of course.
4907,15,1,15,"Marshall: Victoria, ""How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?"""
4908,15,1,15,"Ted: Wait, the card actually says ""Ted?"""
4909,15,1,15,"Victoria: Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two."
4910,15,1,15,Robin: Prude alert.
4911,15,1,15,Victoria: Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between.
4912,15,1,15,"Robin: Oh, slut alert!"
4913,15,1,15,"Barney: Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me."
4914,15,1,15,Marshall: Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.
4915,15,1,15,"Lily: Barney, what was on that tape?"
4916,15,1,15,Barney: Too bad you'll never find out.
4917,15,1,15,"Lily: Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did."
4918,15,1,15,Barney: What?!
4919,15,1,15,Marshall: Drink!
4920,15,1,15,"Lily: Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?"
4921,15,1,15,"Barney: Give it to me, give it, give me..."
4922,15,1,15,"Ted: Play the tape, play it, play it!"
4923,15,1,15,"Barney: Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's..."

4932,15,1,15,"Lily: Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay."
4933,15,1,15,All: Come on. Stay!
4934,15,1,15,"Barney: I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me."
4935,15,1,15,"Marshall: Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it."
4936,15,1,15,"Barney: Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is."
4937,15,1,15,Marshall: All right.

4939,15,1,15,"Marshall: I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants."

4954,15,1,15,"Barney: Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine."

4964,15,1,15,"Marshall: Oh, I know just how to decide who."

5005,15,1,15,"Marshall: Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?"
5006,15,1,15,"Lily: Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste."
5007,15,1,15,Marshall: So we've got the whole place to ourselves.

5020,15,1,15,Barney: We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?
5021,15,1,15,"Shannon: Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff."

5036,15,1,15,Lily: You've got to tell us.
5037,15,1,15,"Barney: I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it."
5038,15,1,15,Ted: Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...
5039,15,1,15,"Barney: Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?"
5040,15,1,15,"Ted: You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, ""I love you."" Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there."
5041,15,1,15,[FLASHBACK]
5042,15,1,15,Ted: We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.
5043,15,1,15,Ranjit: To one hell of a night!
5044,15,1,15,"Ted: And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now."
5045,15,1,15,Barney: Yes! Do it!
5046,15,1,15,Ranjit: To the cab.
5047,15,1,15,"(Ted arrives in front of Robin's door, he throws up on her doormat)"
5048,15,1,15,Robin: Hello? Is someone out there?
5049,15,1,15,"( Ted, Barney et Ranjit run out. Robin opens her door, et sees her doormat...)"
5050,15,1,15,[END OF FLASHBACK]
5051,15,1,15,Lily: You ralphed and ran?
5052,15,1,15,Marshall: I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?
5053,15,1,15,Robin: You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.
5054,15,1,15,Ted: Sorry.
5055,15,1,15,Robin: It's okay.
5056,15,1,15,"Ted: Victoria, I know this must be..."
5057,15,1,15,Victoria: Yeah. It kind of is.
5058,15,1,15,"Barney: Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future."
5059,15,1,15,"Marshall: Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year."
5060,15,1,15,"Barney: Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight."
5061,15,1,15,[FLASHBACK]
5062,15,1,15,Barney: Hi.
5063,15,1,15,Shannon: Barney?
5064,15,1,15,"Barney: Hi, Shannon."
5065,15,1,15,Shannon: What are you doing here?
5066,15,1,15,"Barney: Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life."
5067,15,1,15,[END OF FLASHBACK]
5068,15,1,15,"Barney: She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands."
5069,15,1,15,"Lily: Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse."
5070,15,1,15,"Barney: My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her."
5071,15,1,15,Lily: Nope.
5072,15,1,15,Barney: Yeah.
5073,15,1,15,Lily: Nope.
5074,15,1,15,Barney: Yeah.
5075,15,1,15,"Lily: Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God."
5076,15,1,15,"Shannon: Oh, Barney!"
5077,15,1,15,"Barney: Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?"
5078,15,1,15,Shannon: Is your phone on?
5079,15,1,15,"Barney: Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down."
5080,15,1,15,"Lily: Ew, gross. Just stop it."
5081,15,1,15,"Barney: Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!"
5082,15,1,15,(Barney leaves the bar)
5083,15,1,15,Marshall: I think Barney just won game night.
5084,15,1,15,"Ted from 2030: We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden even from our closest friends. But those rare times when we do open up, it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming. Of course, not every secret was told that night. But that's getting ahead of the story."
5085,16,1,16,Ted's kitchen
5086,16,1,16,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally."
5087,16,1,16,Ted: My first solo batch.
5088,16,1,16,"Victoria: Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage."
5089,16,1,16,"Ted from 2030: Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great."
5090,16,1,16,"(Barney arrives, while Marshall is coloring his butt)"
5091,16,1,16,"Barney: Um, are you coloring in your butt?"
5092,16,1,16,"Marshall: I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt."
5093,16,1,16,Barney: So wear another one.
5094,16,1,16,Marshall: I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.
5095,16,1,16,"Barney: Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door."
5096,16,1,16,"Marshall: Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world."
5097,16,1,16,"Barney: Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor."
5098,16,1,16,"Marshall: A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding."
5099,16,1,16,"Barney: Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks ""suit."" Tomorrow, noon, my tailor."
5100,16,1,16,"Marshall: No thanks, dude. (Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart) Noon?"
5101,16,1,16,Barney: Noon. See you then.
5102,16,1,16,The Bar
5103,16,1,16,"Victoria: Hey, girls."
5104,16,1,16,Robin and Lily: Hey.
5105,16,1,16,"Victoria: Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner."
5106,16,1,16,"Robin: Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask."
5107,16,1,16,Lily: Robin!
5108,16,1,16,"Robin: Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship."
5109,16,1,16,Victoria: Really? Oh.
5110,16,1,16,"Robin: Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again."
5111,16,1,16,"Victoria: What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount."
5112,16,1,16,Lily: Really? That'd be great.
5113,16,1,16,Victoria: Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.
5114,16,1,16,"Robin: Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?"
5115,16,1,16,"Lily: Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?"
5116,16,1,16,Robin: The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.
5117,16,1,16,"Lily: Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?"
5118,16,1,16,Victoria: I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.
5119,16,1,16,The Bar
5120,16,1,16,"Ted: Wait. Germany, Europe?"
5121,16,1,16,"Victoria: It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in."
5122,16,1,16,"Ted: So, this is the Europe Germany?"
5123,16,1,16,Victoria: What other Germany would it be?
5124,16,1,16,Ted: The one in Epcot?
5125,16,1,16,Victoria: Ted.
5126,16,1,16,Ted: Sorry. Congratulations.
5127,16,1,16,Victoria: Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.
5128,16,1,16,"Ted: Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?"
5129,16,1,16,Victoria: I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.
5130,16,1,16,"Ted: Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college."
5131,16,1,16,"Victoria: So, that leaves us with..."
5132,16,1,16,"Ted: Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel..."
5133,16,1,16,Victoria: I have to leave on Monday.
5134,16,1,16,"Ted: Monday, September the...?"
5135,16,1,16,Victoria: Ted. Do you have any thoughts?
5136,16,1,16,Ted: Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.
5137,16,1,16,Victoria: It's a date.
5138,16,1,16,Ted from 2030: And that's when things got complicated.
5139,16,1,16,Marshall is At Barney's tailor / Lily is shopping for her wedding dress with Victoria and Robin
5140,16,1,16,"Marshall: Hey, baby, how's the dress place?"
5141,16,1,16,Lily: Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?
5142,16,1,16,"Marshall: Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind."
5143,16,1,16,"Lily: Well, good luck, baby."
5144,16,1,16,"Marshall: Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?"
5145,16,1,16,"Barney: Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process."
5146,16,1,16,Marshall: You speak Ukrainian?
5147,16,1,16,"Ted: Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option."
5148,16,1,16,"Marshall: No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now."
5149,16,1,16,Barney: Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.
5150,16,1,16,Ted: Really? You?
5151,16,1,16,"Barney: Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney."
5152,16,1,16,"Marshall: Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?"
5153,16,1,16,Ted: Yeah.
5154,16,1,16,"Marshall: Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, ""You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am."
5155,16,1,16,"Ted: Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?"
5156,16,1,16,"Marshall: Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay."
5157,16,1,16,"Ted: Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be."
5158,16,1,16,"Marshall: Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling."
5159,16,1,16,"Ted: Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people."
5160,16,1,16,Barney: Are you sure?
5161,16,1,16,Ted: All right. (He calls Victoria)
5162,16,1,16,Victoria: Hello.
5163,16,1,16,"Ted: Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?"
5164,16,1,16,"Victoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal."
5165,16,1,16,"Ted: Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all."
5166,16,1,16,"Barney: Oh, excellent. We'll take this one."
5167,16,1,16,"Marshall: Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?"
5168,16,1,16,Barney: Here. Play with this pin cushion.
5169,16,1,16,Marshall: God. I'm going to look hot.
5170,16,1,16,"Barney: Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot."
5171,16,1,16,Marshall: No way. The Kid does not sell out.
5172,16,1,16,"Barney: Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year."
5173,16,1,16,Marshall: No. I've made my decision.
5174,16,1,16,"Ted: So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go."
5175,16,1,16,In a restaurant
5176,16,1,16,Ted from 2030: And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.
5177,16,1,16,"Victoria: All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking."
5178,16,1,16,Ted: I want you to stay.
5179,16,1,16,At the Tailor / At the wedding shop
5180,16,1,16,Marshall: Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.
5181,16,1,16,"Lily: Oh, good luck, baby."
5182,16,1,16,Marshall: Bye.
5183,16,1,16,"Woman: Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?"
5184,16,1,16,Lily: Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.
5185,16,1,16,Robin: I saw a couple up front that were nice.
5186,16,1,16,"By the window? No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range."
5187,16,1,16,Lily: Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.
5188,16,1,16,"Victoria: Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear."
5189,16,1,16,Lily: Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!
5190,16,1,16,Victoria: At least we get free champagne!
5191,16,1,16,Robin: And cake.
5192,16,1,16,Victoria: Mm-hmm.
5193,16,1,16,"Robin: Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?"
5194,16,1,16,"Victoria: You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works."
5195,16,1,16,Lily: Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.
5196,16,1,16,"Victoria: I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from."
5197,16,1,16,"Robin: Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months."
5198,16,1,16,Victoria: But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.
5199,16,1,16,"Robin: Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean."
5200,16,1,16,Victoria: I really don't...
5201,16,1,16,"Robin: s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked."
5202,16,1,16,Woman: Thanks.
5203,16,1,16,Victoria and Robin: Oh!
5204,16,1,16,"Lily: It's okay, guys, I hate it."
5205,16,1,16,Victoria: Just horrible.
5206,16,1,16,"Robin: It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses."
5207,16,1,16,"Lily: You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him."
5208,16,1,16,Victoria: But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.
5209,16,1,16,"Ted: Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?"
5210,16,1,16,"Victoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal."
5211,16,1,16,Robin: A cat person. Why am I not surprised?
5212,16,1,16,Victoria: Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?
5213,16,1,16,Lily: Maybe he's going to buy you one.
5214,16,1,16,Victoria: I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?
5215,16,1,16,Robin: Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.
5216,16,1,16,Victoria: That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?
5217,16,1,16,"Robin: Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany."
5218,16,1,16,Victoria and Robin: Aw.
5219,16,1,16,"Lily: Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars."
5220,16,1,16,"Robin: Ugly, ugly, ugly."
5221,16,1,16,"Victoria: I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun."
5222,16,1,16,Lily: Are you okay?
5223,16,1,16,Robin: I'm fine.
5224,16,1,16,Lily: Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.
5225,16,1,16,"Robin: I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship."
5226,16,1,16,"Lily: Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket."
5227,16,1,16,"Victoria: Somebody say ""beautiful princess."""
5228,16,1,16,"Lily: Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night."
5229,16,1,16,"Victoria: Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something."
5230,16,1,16,Robin: I know what you mean.
5231,16,1,16,Victoria: You do?
5232,16,1,16,"Lily: Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description."
5233,16,1,16,"Victoria: See, that's what I'm afraid of."
5234,16,1,16,Robin: Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.
5235,16,1,16,Victoria: Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.
5236,16,1,16,"Robin: Oh, no way... you're the coolest."
5237,16,1,16,"Victoria: No, you are."
5238,16,1,16,"Robin: Okay, I am."
5239,16,1,16,Victoria: I'm going to stay.
5240,16,1,16,Victoria and Robin: Aw.
5241,16,1,16,"Lily: Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty."
5242,16,1,16,"Robin: Wow, you look incredible."
5243,16,1,16,"Lily: Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?"
5244,16,1,16,"Robin: Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity."
5245,16,1,16,"Lily: Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?"
5246,16,1,16,"Robin: Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake."
5247,16,1,16,"Victoria: But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry."
5248,16,1,16,"Robin: Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is."

5250,16,1,16,Lily: It was like this when I found it?

5254,16,1,16,"Victoria: I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking."
5255,16,1,16,Ted: I want you to stay.
5256,16,1,16,Victoria: I have to go to Germany.
5257,16,1,16,Ted: You're going?
5258,16,1,16,Victoria: Yes. I have to.
5259,16,1,16,Ted: So that's what you decided?
5260,16,1,16,"Victoria: Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go."
5261,16,1,16,"Ted: What is this, opposite day or something?"
5262,16,1,16,Victoria: No.
5263,16,1,16,Ted: So it is?
5264,16,1,16,"Victoria: Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me."
5265,16,1,16,"Ted: I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are."
5266,16,1,16,"Victoria: Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?"
5267,16,1,16,"Ted: Well, that's just crazy."
5268,16,1,16,"Victoria: Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy."
5269,16,1,16,Ted: But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.
5270,16,1,16,Victoria: You'd have me.
5271,16,1,16,"Ted: We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this."
5272,16,1,16,Victoria: So... we're breaking up?
5273,16,1,16,Ted: I guess so. I guess so.

5276,16,1,16,"Marshall: God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry."
5277,16,1,16,"Ted: It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome."
5278,16,1,16,"Marshall: Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?"
5279,16,1,16,Ted: She's leaving tomorrow.
5280,16,1,16,"Marshall: Yeah, but she's still in town."
5281,16,1,16,"Ted: Yeah, she... she's still in town."
5282,16,1,16,"Marshall: Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?"
5283,16,1,16,"Ted: Awesome air kicks, huh?"
5284,16,1,16,Marshall: New pajama bottoms?
5285,16,1,16,Ted: You know it.
5286,16,1,16,The Bar
5287,16,1,16,"Ted: So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off."
5288,16,1,16,"Victoria: Wait, so we're sharing the leg?"
5289,16,1,16,"Ted: No, the leg is a metaphor."
5290,16,1,16,"Victoria: How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted."
5291,16,1,16,"Ted: Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?"
5292,16,1,16,"Victoria: Well, what would you want to do?"
5293,16,1,16,Ted: Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.
5294,16,1,16,Victoria: Like go to the Mets.
5295,16,1,16,"Ted: Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."
5296,16,1,16,Victoria: See some monkeys at the zoo?
5297,16,1,16,Ted: Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?
5298,16,1,16,Victoria: Wow! We better get going.
5299,16,1,16,"Ted: Yeah, big day."
5300,16,1,16,Victoria: Yeah.
5301,16,1,16,"Ted from 2030: And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things."

5303,16,1,16,"Robin: Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune."
5304,16,1,16,"Lily: No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison."
5305,16,1,16,"Robin: Well, here's hoping he cheats on you."
5306,16,1,16,"Lily: Yeah, but only, like, second base."
5307,16,1,16,"Barney: Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash."
5308,16,1,16,"Marshall: Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own."
5309,16,1,16,"Barney: So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?"
5310,16,1,16,"Marshall: Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp."
5311,16,1,16,"Barney: Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill."
5312,16,1,16,"Marshall: B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price."
5313,16,1,16,"Barney: Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company."
5314,16,1,16,Marshall: You set this up! You set this whole thing up!
5315,16,1,16,Barney: I most certainly did...
5316,16,1,16,"Marshall: Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise."
5317,16,1,16,"Lily: I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress."
5318,16,1,16,Marshall: What time is the interview?
5319,16,1,16,"Barney: 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy."
5320,16,1,16,At the airport
5321,16,1,16,Victoria: I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.
5322,16,1,16,"Ted: Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the s*x."
5323,16,1,16,Victoria: I'm going to miss you so much.
5324,16,1,16,"Ted: I'm going to miss you, too."
5325,16,1,16,"Victoria: Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can..."
5326,16,1,16,Ted: Even if we're not.
5327,16,1,16,Victoria: Okay.
5328,16,1,16,"Ted: Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?"
5329,16,1,16,Victoria: Yes. Yes!
5330,16,1,16,Ted: We can beat the odds.
5331,16,1,16,"Victoria: Odds, schmodds."
5332,16,1,16,Ted: It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.
5333,16,1,16,"Ted from 2030: It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later."

5335,17,1,17,"Ted from 2030: When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old, he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas. It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question."
5336,17,1,17,Marshall: What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?
5337,17,1,17,Dr. Birnholz: So you want to be an anthropologist?
5338,17,1,17,"Marshall: Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did."
5339,17,1,17,Ted from 2030: What she said next changed his life.
5340,17,1,17,"Dr. Birnholz: Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't. They'll all be dead by then..."
5341,17,1,17,[in 2006]
5342,17,1,17,"Marshall:...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out."
5343,17,1,17,Ted: So you don't want coffee.
5344,17,1,17,Marshall: I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...
5345,17,1,17,Ted: All right. I'm pouring it out.
5346,17,1,17,"Marshall: Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything."
5347,17,1,17,"Ted: I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. ""The kid"" has become ""the man."""
5348,17,1,17,"Marshall: Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming."
5349,17,1,17,Ted from 2030: Well... I mean... they did their best.
5350,17,1,17,Lily: Here's your sack lunch.
5351,17,1,17,"Marshall: Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word ""sack""."
5352,17,1,17,"Lily: I love you, Marshmallow."
5353,17,1,17,Marshall: I love you.

5357,17,1,17,"Marshall: Yeah. Yeah, she did."
5358,17,1,17,Ted: Another care package?
5359,17,1,17,Ted from 2030: Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.
5360,17,1,17,Marshall: How many is that so far?
5361,17,1,17,Ted: Three.
5362,17,1,17,Lily: And how many have you sent her?
5363,17,1,17,"Ted: In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now."
5364,17,1,17,"Marshall: God, that is so me at 15."
5365,17,1,17,"Ted from 2030: Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there."

5372,17,1,17,Barney: Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.
5373,17,1,17,Marshall: Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.
5374,17,1,17,"Barney: Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness..."
5375,17,1,17,Marshall: There's one for awesomeness?
5376,17,1,17,"Barney: Yeah, I had it made. Sit."

5385,17,1,17,"Marshall: Where, I don't, I don't see..."
5386,17,1,17,Barney: Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.
5387,17,1,17,"Bilson: Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?"
5388,17,1,17,Marshall: I don't have a back door.
5389,17,1,17,"Bilson: Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise. Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go."
5390,17,1,17,"Marshall: Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--"

5408,17,1,17,"Robin: All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago."
5409,17,1,17,"Ted: That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you."
5410,17,1,17,Robin: That is funny.

5441,17,1,17,Marshall: I quit.
5442,17,1,17,"Barney: What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great."
5443,17,1,17,"Marshall: We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?"
5444,17,1,17,Barney: Please.
5445,17,1,17,"Marshall: I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me."

5447,17,1,17,Marshall: What?
5448,17,1,17,Barney: Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?
5449,17,1,17,Marshall: The package?
5450,17,1,17,Barney: The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.
5451,17,1,17,Marshall: Lily doesn't care about that stuff.
5452,17,1,17,"Barney: Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver."
5453,17,1,17,Marshall: She'll be happy.
5454,17,1,17,Barney: Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.
5455,17,1,17,At Marshall's work
5456,17,1,17,Bilson: And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.

5465,17,1,17,"Ted: So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say."

5471,17,1,17,Robin: It's pretty clear.
5472,17,1,17,Ted: I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

5480,17,1,17,"Barney: Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier."

5483,17,1,17,"Lily: Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational."
5484,17,1,17,"Marshall: Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?"
5485,17,1,17,Lily: It sounds kinda like peer pressure.
5486,17,1,17,"Marshall: No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it."
5487,17,1,17,"Lily: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year."
5488,17,1,17,Marshall: I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.
5489,17,1,17,"Lily: All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?"
5490,17,1,17,Marshall: Only when I'm drunk.

5492,17,1,17,"Ted from 2030: And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons."
5493,17,1,17,The Bar
5494,17,1,17,"Barney: Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too."
5495,17,1,17,"Marshall: Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched."
5496,17,1,17,"Barney: Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it."
5497,17,1,17,Marshall: I'm psyched!
5498,17,1,17,"Barney: What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon."
5499,17,1,17,"Marshall: Wow, that was really specific."
5500,17,1,17,Barney: Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!
5501,17,1,17,Marshall: So badly.
5502,17,1,17,Barney: And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.
5503,17,1,17,Marshall: Right. Get what done?
5504,17,1,17,Barney: Whatever.
5505,17,1,17,Marshall: Cool. And what guy is this?
5506,17,1,17,Barney: There's always a guy.
5507,17,1,17,"Marshall: Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready."
5508,17,1,17,Barney: You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?
5509,17,1,17,"Marshall: All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, ""Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."" So I'm, like, ""Snapadoo!"" So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh."
5510,17,1,17,Blauman: Eriksen...that was steak sauce!
5511,17,1,17,Bilson: Great story.

5513,17,1,17,"Ted from 2030: The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail."
5514,17,1,17,Ted: Uh-oh.
5515,17,1,17,The Bar
5516,17,1,17,"Victoria's voice: ""Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night. This long-distance thing sucks, huh? Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight. I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."" So?"
5517,17,1,17,"Ted: So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, ""Listen, I've been thinking,"" and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?"
5518,17,1,17,"Robin: I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you."
5519,17,1,17,"Ted: Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?"
5520,17,1,17,Robin: I'd wait.

5522,17,1,17,"(Marshall is on the phone, Lily is painting)"
5523,17,1,17,"Marshall: 'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet."
5524,17,1,17,Lily: Okay...what do you think?
5525,17,1,17,Marshall: Steak sauce.
5526,17,1,17,Lily: Steak sauce?
5527,17,1,17,Marshall: Yeah.
5528,17,1,17,"Lily: Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here."
5529,17,1,17,"Marshall: Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-..."
5530,17,1,17,"Lily: No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office."
5531,17,1,17,Marshall: Why?
5532,17,1,17,"Lily: Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame."
5533,17,1,17,"Marshall: Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?"
5534,17,1,17,Lily: Okay.
5535,17,1,17,At the karaoke
5536,17,1,17,"Blauman: But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go."
5537,17,1,17,"Bilson: Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah."
5538,17,1,17,Lily: You're right. They're delightful.
5539,17,1,17,"Marshall: So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?"
5540,17,1,17,Barney: Nah. I'm so over karaoke.
5541,17,1,17,Marshall: Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.
5542,17,1,17,"Barney: Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard."
5543,17,1,17,"Lily: Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."""
5544,17,1,17,Bilson: What?
5545,17,1,17,"Marshall: ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart."" Elton John, Kiki Dee."
5546,17,1,17,Bilson: No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.
5547,17,1,17,"Lily: Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine."
5548,17,1,17,"Marshall: ""Iron Man."" I could do ""Iron Man."""
5549,17,1,17,Blauman: Steak sauce.
5550,17,1,17,"Bilson: Steak sauce, dude."
5551,17,1,17,"Blauman: Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes!"
5552,17,1,17,Bilson: That's my man!
5553,17,1,17,"Blauman: I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office."
5554,17,1,17,"Lily: Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?"
5555,17,1,17,"Marshall: Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package."
5556,17,1,17,"Lily: The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package."
5557,17,1,17,"Marshall: Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package."
5558,17,1,17,"Lily: Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package."

5562,17,1,17,Ted: Why hasn't she called yet?
5563,17,1,17,"Robin: Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something."
5564,17,1,17,"Ted: No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership."
5565,17,1,17,"Robin: I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome."
5566,17,1,17,"Ted: Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg."
5567,17,1,17,"Ted from 2030: And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me."
5568,17,1,17,Ted: I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.

5571,17,1,17,"Barney, singing: *He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...*"
5572,17,1,17,Ted: Marshall.
5573,17,1,17,"Marshall: Hey, hey."
5574,17,1,17,"Ted: Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month."
5575,17,1,17,Marshall: Yeah. Yeah. How you doing?
5576,17,1,17,Ted: I think Victoria's about to break up with me.
5577,17,1,17,"Marshall: Oh, God, I'm sorry, man."
5578,17,1,17,"Ted: Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone."
5579,17,1,17,Marshall: Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.
5580,17,1,17,"Ted: I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?"
5581,17,1,17,"Barney, singing: *Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...* Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?"

5587,17,1,17,"Lily: *Baby, you're not that kind...*"
5588,17,1,17,"Ted from 2030: It turns out some things are worth preserving. But here's the real question: It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany, who was supposed to call four hours ago. And then the phone rings."
5589,17,1,17,Ted: Hello.
5590,17,1,17,"Robin: Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?"

5605,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: Kids, your grandma always used to say to me, ""Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m.,"" and she was right. When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep. Case in point:"
5606,18,1,18,Ted: Hello.
5607,18,1,18,"Robin: Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?"

5618,18,1,18,"Robin: No, I've got five dogs."
5619,18,1,18,Little Girl: My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.
5620,18,1,18,"Robin: Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is..."
5621,18,1,18,Robin: Does anyone else have a...? Yes?
5622,18,1,18,Little Boy: Are you a lesbian?
5623,18,1,18,Robin: No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...

5641,18,1,18,"Robin: What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things."
5642,18,1,18,Man: We should have s*x.
5643,18,1,18,Robin: What?
5644,18,1,18,"Man: Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way."
5645,18,1,18,"Robin: Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with."
5646,18,1,18,"Man: Get involved? Who said get involved? I'm just saying we should have s*x, it could be fun."

5654,18,1,18,"Robin: Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, ""You know who likes juice? Ted."""
5655,18,1,18,Ted: I love juice.
5656,18,1,18,Robin: Great. So you want to come over and make juice?
5657,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions."

5663,18,1,18,In a cab
5664,18,1,18,Ted: This is fine. This is totally fine.
5665,18,1,18,Cab driver: What's fine?
5666,18,1,18,"Ted: Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice."
5667,18,1,18,Cab driver: Nice.
5668,18,1,18,"Ted: No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?"
5669,18,1,18,"Cab driver: You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip?"
5670,18,1,18,Ted: You can just let me out right up here.
5671,18,1,18,In another cab
5672,18,1,18,"Cab driver: Where you going to, buddy?"
5673,18,1,18,"Ted: Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house..."
5674,18,1,18,"Victoria: And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?"
5675,18,1,18,"Ted: Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend."
5676,18,1,18,Victoria: Right. You're going to go make some juice.
5677,18,1,18,"Ted: Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy."
5678,18,1,18,"Victoria: Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?"
5679,18,1,18,"Ted: I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head."
5680,18,1,18,"Victoria: Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head."
5681,18,1,18,Ted: Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.
5682,18,1,18,Victoria: Right.
5683,18,1,18,"Ted: Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine."

5686,18,1,18,"Marshall: Hey, did she call?"
5687,18,1,18,"Ted: No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out."
5688,18,1,18,"Marshall: Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?"
5689,18,1,18,"Barney: Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?"
5690,18,1,18,Marshall & Lily: What?
5691,18,1,18,"Barney: Yeah, she told me already. Go on."
5692,18,1,18,Marshall: Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?
5693,18,1,18,"Barney: Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are."
5694,18,1,18,"Marshall: Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are."
5695,18,1,18,Barney: That is a lie!
5696,18,1,18,Marshall: It is not a lie.
5697,18,1,18,"Barney: Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!"
5698,18,1,18,Marshall: I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army!
5699,18,1,18,In the cab
5700,18,1,18,"Ted: Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!"
5701,18,1,18,Victoria: Cupcake?
5702,18,1,18,"Ted: No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?"
5703,18,1,18,"Victoria: Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now."
5704,18,1,18,Ted: Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.
5705,18,1,18,"Marshall: Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude."
5706,18,1,18,"Ted: Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen."
5707,18,1,18,"Marshall: Ted, what does your mom always say?"
5708,18,1,18,Ted: Nothing good ever...
5709,18,1,18,Marshall: Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.
5710,18,1,18,"Ted: Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way."
5711,18,1,18,"Lily: Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me."
5712,18,1,18,Ted: What?
5713,18,1,18,"Lily: It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted."
5714,18,1,18,Ted: She-she likes me?
5715,18,1,18,"Lily: Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted."
5716,18,1,18,Ted: She likes me?
5717,18,1,18,"Lily: Go home, Ted."
5718,18,1,18,"Ted: Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home."
5719,18,1,18,Lily: Good. He's going home.
5720,18,1,18,Marshall: He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.
5721,18,1,18,Lily: What do you mean?
5722,18,1,18,"Marshall: Lily, here's what you just said: ""Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have s*x with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice."""
5723,18,1,18,"Lily: No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that."
5724,18,1,18,Ted from 2030: I did have more sense than that.
5725,18,1,18,Ted: Keep the change.
5726,18,1,18,Cab driver: Thanks.
5727,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep."
5728,18,1,18,Victoria: So you're doing this? You're going up there?
5729,18,1,18,Ted: You want to get out of the way?
5730,18,1,18,Victoria: I'm not in the way.
5731,18,1,18,"Ted: You know, if you had just called me, I..."
5732,18,1,18,Robin: Hi.
5733,18,1,18,"Ted: Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets."
5734,18,1,18,Robin: Or we could just drink wine.
5735,18,1,18,"Ted: Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said."
5736,18,1,18,Robin: Thanks.
5737,18,1,18,Ted: Make it a big glass.
5738,18,1,18,Robin: Sure.
5739,18,1,18,"Ted: So, how's it hanging?"
5740,18,1,18,Robin: Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?
5741,18,1,18,"Ted: Uh, about once a week."
5742,18,1,18,"Robin: I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?"
5743,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep."
5744,18,1,18,Ted: We broke up.
5745,18,1,18,Robin: What?
5746,18,1,18,"Ted: Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me."
5747,18,1,18,"Robin: Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful."
5748,18,1,18,Ted: You're smiling.
5749,18,1,18,"Robin: Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too."
5750,18,1,18,Ted: Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.
5751,18,1,18,
5752,18,1,18,At the karaoke
5753,18,1,18,*There's got to be a morning after...*
5754,18,1,18,Marshall: How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.
5755,18,1,18,"Lily: Okay, it's time for bed."
5756,18,1,18,Barney: What? No. It's 2:30.
5757,18,1,18,Lily: Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.
5758,18,1,18,"Barney: You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way."
5759,18,1,18,Marshall: You never had a four-way.
5760,18,1,18,"Barney: I said ""almost."" All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary."
5761,18,1,18,Lily: We're going home.
5762,18,1,18,"Barney: What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?"
5763,18,1,18,Korean Elvis: Rock 'n' roll.
5764,18,1,18,Barney: And it begins.
5765,18,1,18,At Robin's
5766,18,1,18,"Ted: So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look."
5767,18,1,18,"Robin: Oh, yeah. Do you like it?"
5768,18,1,18,"Ted: Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right."
5769,18,1,18,(Ted's phone starts rigging)
5770,18,1,18,Robin: Wow. Weird.
5771,18,1,18,"Ted: Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this."
5772,18,1,18,Robin: I'll be here.
5773,18,1,18,(Ted goes out in the hall)
5774,18,1,18,Ted: Hello?
5775,18,1,18,"Korean Elvis: Ted, this is your main man, K.E. I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?"
5776,18,1,18,Marshall: Sorry about that.
5777,18,1,18,Ted: Was that Korean Elvis?
5778,18,1,18,"Marshall: I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's."
5779,18,1,18,"Ted: Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria."
5780,18,1,18,"Marshall: Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?"
5781,18,1,18,"Ted: What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria."
5782,18,1,18,Lily: Gonna?
5783,18,1,18,Ted: Yes. First thing tomorrow.
5784,18,1,18,"Lily: Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way."
5785,18,1,18,Ted: I hate how you're always right.
5786,18,1,18,Lily: It's my best and most annoying trait.
5787,18,1,18,Ted: Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.
5788,18,1,18,(Ted comes back to Robin's appartment)
5789,18,1,18,Robin: Hey.
5790,18,1,18,Ted: I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...
5791,18,1,18,"Robin: Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah."
5792,18,1,18,Ted: Can I call you tomorrow?
5793,18,1,18,Robin: Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.
5794,18,1,18,"Ted: Okay. Good night, Robin."
5795,18,1,18,"Robin: Good night, Ted."
5796,18,1,18,They embrace each other
5797,18,1,18,"Robin: Oh, my God. We're making out."
5798,18,1,18,Ted: Right.
5799,18,1,18,Robin: This is crazy.
5800,18,1,18,Ted: Right? Right?
5801,18,1,18,"Robin: Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but..."
5802,18,1,18,Ted: Yeah.
5803,18,1,18,Robin: Yeah?
5804,18,1,18,"Ted: Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick."
5805,18,1,18,Robin: Okay.
5806,18,1,18,(Ted goes to the bathroom while Robin waits in the living room)
5807,18,1,18,Ted: Stop doing that.
5808,18,1,18,Victoria: Whatcha doin'?
5809,18,1,18,"Ted: I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man."
5810,18,1,18,"Victoria: Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive..."
5811,18,1,18,Ted: What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.
5812,18,1,18,Victoria: Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.
5813,18,1,18,Ted: It's not ideal.
5814,18,1,18,The Bar
5815,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m."
5816,18,1,18,"Barney: Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?"
5817,18,1,18,Lily: I think he just spat on me.
5818,18,1,18,"Marshall: Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going."
5819,18,1,18,"Barney: No! No, come on."
5820,18,1,18,Marshall: Yes!
5821,18,1,18,"Barney: Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the ""le"". We still got the ""gen."" The ""da."" The ""ry."""
5822,18,1,18,"Lily: Okay, if we're at the ""le,"" then I say we follow it up with a ""t's go home."""
5823,18,1,18,"Marshall: Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style."
5824,18,1,18,"Korean Elvis: No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh?"
5825,18,1,18,"Lily: Okay, seriously."
5826,18,1,18,"Korean Elvis: Hey, I know what you like."
5827,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards."
5828,18,1,18,"Marshall: Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?"
5829,18,1,18,At Robin's
5830,18,1,18,Ted: You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.
5831,18,1,18,Victoria: Good. So you're gonna go home?
5832,18,1,18,"Ted: Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry."
5833,18,1,18,Victoria: Ted.
5834,18,1,18,"Ted: It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay."
5835,18,1,18,"Victoria: Oh, please. You just want to get laid."
5836,18,1,18,"Ted: Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night."
5837,18,1,18,Victoria: That's not your phone.
5838,18,1,18,Ted: This isn't my phone.
5839,18,1,18,(He goes back to the livingroom; Robin's on the phone)
5840,18,1,18,"Robin: Okay. Bye. (She hungs up) I thought it was mine, so I answered it."
5841,18,1,18,Ted: Was it...?
5842,18,1,18,Robin: It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.
5843,18,1,18,"Ted from 2030: I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up. Yes... And there you have it, kids. The stupidest thing I've ever done. In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about. And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom. So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this: when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep."
5844,19,1,19,"[In 2006, 3 months earlier, at the Bar]"
5845,19,1,19,"Ted: Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours."
5846,19,1,19,"Lily: What do you mean ""could""?"
5847,19,1,19,"Ted: I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it."
5848,19,1,19,"Barney: Trust that impulse, Ted."
5849,19,1,19,"Robin: Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award."
5850,19,1,19,Lily: A... LAME-A?
5851,19,1,19,"Robin: We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar."
5852,19,1,19,All: Yes! Word up!
5853,19,1,19,"Ted: Yeah, put me down for two."
5854,19,1,19,Robin: Really? It's three months away.
5855,19,1,19,"Ted: I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time."
5856,19,1,19,"[3 months later, at the Bar]"
5857,19,1,19,Ted: I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.
5858,19,1,19,Barney: You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?
5859,19,1,19,"Ted: Yes, that's what I meant by ""you know."" I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go."
5860,19,1,19,"Marshall: You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her."
5861,19,1,19,"Barney: Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs."
5862,19,1,19,Ted: That's only two.
5863,19,1,19,Barney: Count again.
5864,19,1,19,"Ted: Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours."
5865,19,1,19,Barney: So get an escort.
5866,19,1,19,"Ted: By ""escort,"" you mean prostitute?"
5867,19,1,19,Barney: Why not?
5868,19,1,19,Ted: Because... gross?
5869,19,1,19,"Barney: Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession."
5870,19,1,19,Marshall: You really think that's true?
5871,19,1,19,"Barney: Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out."
5872,19,1,19,"Marshall: Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered."
5873,19,1,19,"Barney: Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun."
5874,19,1,19,"Ted: Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have s*x with?"
5875,19,1,19,Barney: Yes.
5876,19,1,19,Ted: No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?
5877,19,1,19,"Barney: That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute."
5878,19,1,19,Marshall: You just made that up.
5879,19,1,19,Barney: Withdrawn.
5880,19,1,19,"Marshall: Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?"
5881,19,1,19,Ted: 57 days.
5882,19,1,19,Barney: Is that your water? May I?
5883,19,1,19,"Ted: Yeah, go ahead."
5884,19,1,19,"Barney: Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump."
5885,19,1,19,"Ted: No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good."
5886,19,1,19,"Barney: Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool."
5887,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp."
5888,19,1,19,Barney: You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day.
5889,19,1,19,"Ted: You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can..."
5890,19,1,19,Barney: I said good day!
5891,19,1,19,At the appartment
5892,19,1,19,Robin: So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.
5893,19,1,19,Lily: What?
5894,19,1,19,Robin: You okay?
5895,19,1,19,"Lily: Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap."
5896,19,1,19,"Robin: Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?"
5897,19,1,19,"Lily: Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?"
5898,19,1,19,"Robin: Ted's still coming to this thing, right?"
5899,19,1,19,Lily: Yep.
5900,19,1,19,"Robin: Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?"
5901,19,1,19,"Lily: Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous."
5902,19,1,19,"Robin: No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?"
5903,19,1,19,"Lily: No, it's not going to be weird at all. (Lily's on the phone with Marshall) Robin's bringing a date."
5904,19,1,19,Marshall: Boy. That's going to be really weird.
5905,19,1,19,Lily: I know.
5906,19,1,19,The Bar
5907,19,1,19,Marshall: Robin's bringing a date.
5908,19,1,19,Ted: Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.
5909,19,1,19,"Marshall: Dude, it's going to be weird."
5910,19,1,19,"Ted: No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird."
5911,19,1,19,"Barney: Yeah, it won't be weird."
5912,19,1,19,Ted: Thank you.
5913,19,1,19,Barney: Because you're going to bring your own date.
5914,19,1,19,"Woman: Hello, Barney."
5915,19,1,19,"Barney: Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?"
5916,19,1,19,Mary: Nice to meet you Ted.
5917,19,1,19,"Ted: Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too."
5918,19,1,19,Mary: So we're going to an award show?
5919,19,1,19,"Ted: Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney."
5920,19,1,19,"Barney: See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable."
5921,19,1,19,Ted: What the hell?
5922,19,1,19,"Barney: Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening."
5923,19,1,19,Ted: You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!
5924,19,1,19,"Barney: Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have s*x with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: ""B"" all night long."
5925,19,1,19,Ted: I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.
5926,19,1,19,"Barney: The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever."
5927,19,1,19,Ted: 500 bucks?
5928,19,1,19,"Barney: Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous."
5929,19,1,19,"Ted: I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul."
5930,19,1,19,Ted from 2030: And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations.
5931,19,1,19,Marshall: Check out Robin's date.
5932,19,1,19,Ted: I know.
5933,19,1,19,Marshall: Is that who I think it is?
5934,19,1,19,Ted: Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.
5935,19,1,19,"Ted from 2030: Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One, the most low-budget cable news network ever."
5936,19,1,19,[FLASHBACK]
5937,19,1,19,Ted: Sandy time. Sandy time!
5938,19,1,19,"Ted from 2030: He was best known for his morning segment ""In Today's Paper,"" during which he literally flipped through today's papers, reading them aloud to viewers."
5939,19,1,19,"Sandy: Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting."
5940,19,1,19,Ted from 2030: These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours.
5941,19,1,19,"Ted: Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p0rn star Sandy...?"
5942,19,1,19,"Marshall: Yosemite Sandy, definitely."
5943,19,1,19,Ted: Excellent choice. I love this guy.
5944,19,1,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
5945,19,1,19,Ted: I hate this guy.
5946,19,1,19,Lily: Hey.
5947,19,1,19,Mary: Hi.
5948,19,1,19,Lily: I'm Lily.
5949,19,1,19,Mary: Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.
5950,19,1,19,"Marshall: Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer."
5951,19,1,19,Ted: Hey.
5952,19,1,19,Robin: Hi.
5953,19,1,19,Ted: You look nice.
5954,19,1,19,"Robin: Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy."
5955,19,1,19,Sandy: Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.
5956,19,1,19,"Ted: Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh..."
5957,19,1,19,Sandy: Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way.
5958,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date."
5959,19,1,19,At the ceremony
5960,19,1,19,"Voice: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards. Please say hello to our host for the evening, king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie, Vampire Lou!"
5961,19,1,19,Vampire Lou: Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting and the triumph of the human spirit.
5962,19,1,19,"Marshall: Man, Vampire Lou just looks great."
5963,19,1,19,Ted: I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.
5964,19,1,19,"Marshall: Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there."
5965,19,1,19,"Barney: Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? ""Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have s*x for money."""
5966,19,1,19,Lily: Who has s*x for money?
5967,19,1,19,Marshall: Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?
5968,19,1,19,"Lily: No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off."
5969,19,1,19,"Ted: Lily, you okay?"
5970,19,1,19,"Lily: Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky."
5971,19,1,19,Sandy: Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.
5972,19,1,19,"Lily: ""Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky."""
5973,19,1,19,Mary: Wow. Why are you so tired?
5974,19,1,19,"Lily: Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time."
5975,19,1,19,"Barney: Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money."
5976,19,1,19,"Lily: Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance."
5977,19,1,19,"Marshall: Well, it's just an internship, for the record."
5978,19,1,19,"Lily: Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?"
5979,19,1,19,Mary: A prostitute.
5980,19,1,19,"Lily: Exactly. Thank you, Mary."
5981,19,1,19,"Robin: So, Mary, what do you do for a living?"
5982,19,1,19,Barney: She's a paralegal.
5983,19,1,19,"Mary: Yes, I'm a paralegal."
5984,19,1,19,"Robin: Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?"
5985,19,1,19,Mary: I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.
5986,19,1,19,"Lily: Oh, what firm?"
5987,19,1,19,"Mary: Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp."
5988,19,1,19,Marshall: That's a real law firm.
5989,19,1,19,Mary: I know.
5990,19,1,19,Marshall: Nice.
5991,19,1,19,Ted: You're pretty good on your feet.
5992,19,1,19,Mary: Are you flirting with me?
5993,19,1,19,Ted: Is that allowed?
5994,19,1,19,"Mary: Yes, it's encouraged."
5995,19,1,19,"Ted: You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!"
5996,19,1,19,"Mary: Well, thank you."
5997,19,1,19,Ted: You're welcome.
5998,19,1,19,"Robin: Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute."
5999,19,1,19,"Ted: So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning."
6000,19,1,19,"Sandy: You got me. What do you do, Ted?"
6001,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific."
6002,19,1,19,Sandy: Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.
6003,19,1,19,"Mary: Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?"
6004,19,1,19,"Ted: You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter."
6005,19,1,19,"Ted from 2030: And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great."
6006,19,1,19,Ted: Hey.
6007,19,1,19,"Robin: Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?"
6008,19,1,19,"Ted: I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened."
6009,19,1,19,"Robin: And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits."
6010,19,1,19,"Ted: So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?"
6011,19,1,19,Robin: We're still friends.
6012,19,1,19,"Ted: Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?"
6013,19,1,19,"Robin: Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?"
6014,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, so now she's a whore?"
6015,19,1,19,Robin: What?
6016,19,1,19,"Ted: You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying."
6017,19,1,19,Sandy: I like that guy.
6018,19,1,19,Ted: Hey.
6019,19,1,19,Sandy: Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?
6020,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome."
6021,19,1,19,"Sandy: Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in."
6022,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing."
6023,19,1,19,Mary: Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.
6024,19,1,19,"Barney: Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30."
6025,19,1,19,Ted: Sleep with a prostitute?
6026,19,1,19,"Barney: No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships."
6027,19,1,19,Marshall: You just made that up.
6028,19,1,19,Barney: Withdrawn.
6029,19,1,19,"Marshall: Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed."
6030,19,1,19,Ted: I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.
6031,19,1,19,"Marshall: Yeah, well... there we go."
6032,19,1,19,"Vampire Lou: Scooter ""Bam-Bam"" Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky."
6033,19,1,19,"Robin: Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you."
6034,19,1,19,Marshall: Congratulations.
6035,19,1,19,"Robin: Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?"
6036,19,1,19,Sandy: Sure. Let's go.
6037,19,1,19,"Ted: Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room."
6038,19,1,19,"Marshall: Dude, what are you doing?"
6039,19,1,19,Ted: What's it look like?
6040,19,1,19,"Marshall: It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this."
6041,19,1,19,"Ted: Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous."
6042,19,1,19,"Marshall: Oh, that's real mature."
6043,19,1,19,"Lily: Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?"
6044,19,1,19,"Marshall: Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey."
6045,19,1,19,Mary: Should we go?
6046,19,1,19,Ted: Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.
6047,19,1,19,Robin: Good night.
6048,19,1,19,
6049,19,1,19,In the elevator
6050,19,1,19,"Ted: So, did you and Barney ever...?"
6051,19,1,19,Mary: There's not enough money in the world.
6052,19,1,19,"Ted: Oh, thank God."
6053,19,1,19,"Marshall: Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?"
6054,19,1,19,Robin: I put him in a cab.
6055,19,1,19,Barney: So you and he aren't...?
6056,19,1,19,Robin: I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?
6057,19,1,19,Marshall: He's off trying to make you jealous.
6058,19,1,19,"Robin: Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool."
6059,19,1,19,"Marshall: Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute."
6060,19,1,19,"Lily, waking up: Mary's a prostitute?"
6061,19,1,19,Robin: What?!
6062,19,1,19,Marshall: Barney paid for her.
6063,19,1,19,Lily: Is that true?
6064,19,1,19,"Marshall: We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs."
6065,19,1,19,"Robin: Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?"
6066,19,1,19,"Lily: You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!"
6067,19,1,19,Marshall: That's her napkin.
6068,19,1,19,Lily: No!
6069,19,1,19,"Barney: Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?"
6070,19,1,19,"Vampire Lou: ""Mary's not really a prostitute."""
6071,19,1,19,Marshall: What?
6072,19,1,19,"Barney: That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done."
6073,19,1,19,Marshall: So she's not...?
6074,19,1,19,"Barney: No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean."
6075,19,1,19,In the hall of the hotel
6076,19,1,19,Ted: I feel kind of like Richard Gere.
6077,19,1,19,"Mary: Not shy about your looks, are you?"
6078,19,1,19,"Ted: No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before."
6079,19,1,19,Mary: Done what?
6080,19,1,19,"Ted: You know, been... on a ""date."""
6081,19,1,19,"Mary: Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right?"
6082,19,1,19,"Ted: No. Why, is that so odd?"
6083,19,1,19,"Mary: Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15."
6084,19,1,19,"Ted: God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and..."
6085,19,1,19,"Mary: Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long."
6086,19,1,19,Ted: Must be tough.
6087,19,1,19,"Mary: Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about a**l. Well, here we are."
6088,19,1,19,"Ted: Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker."
6089,19,1,19,Mary: What?
6090,19,1,19,"Ted: Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute."
6091,19,1,19,"Mary: No... Ted, I'm a paralegal."
6092,19,1,19,"Ted: Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker."
6093,19,1,19,"Mary: No, Ted... I'm a paralegal."
6094,19,1,19,"Ted: No, you're a hooker."
6095,19,1,19,"Mary: No, I'm a paralegal."
6096,19,1,19,Ted: You're a paralegal.
6097,19,1,19,The Bar
6098,19,1,19,Ted: That was not funny.
6099,19,1,19,"Marshall: Not funny, dude."
6100,19,1,19,"Barney: I know, it was hilarious."
6101,19,1,19,Ted: Why would you do that?
6102,19,1,19,Barney: I did it to prove a point.
6103,19,1,19,Ted: What point?
6104,19,1,19,"Barney: Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over."
6105,19,1,19,"Ted: So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?"
6106,19,1,19,"Barney: Come on, dude, you should be thanking me."
6107,19,1,19,Ted: She slapped me and stormed off.
6108,19,1,19,Barney: Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.
6109,19,1,19,"Marshall: I'm sorry, dude, it was funny."
6110,19,1,19,"Ted: Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room."
6111,19,1,19,Barney: Your room?
6112,19,1,19,"Ted: Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles."
6113,19,1,19,(Ted leaves)
6114,19,1,19,"Marshall: Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean."
6115,20,1,20,Lily and Marshall are running in the streets
6116,20,1,20,"Ted from 2030: Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement, there occurred a game-changing emergency."
6117,20,1,20,"[12 minutes earlier, at the appartment]"
6118,20,1,20,Marshall: Van Smoot is available.
6119,20,1,20,"Lily: Oh, my God!"
6120,20,1,20,"Ted from 2030: Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River. It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding, but it was never available. And then, suddenly, it was."
6121,20,1,20,Marshall: There was a cancellation two months from now.
6122,20,1,20,Lily: You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.
6123,20,1,20,"Marshall: It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!"
6124,20,1,20,"Lily: No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit."
6125,20,1,20,"Marshall: Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check."
6126,20,1,20,Lily: Todd and Valerie?
6127,20,1,20,(An other couple is running)
6128,20,1,20,"Ted from 2030: When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple."
6129,20,1,20,Marshall: We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!
6130,20,1,20,"Lily: Oh! Kids, color!(Lily runs out of class, Marshall runs out pf the appartment, they join in the street) Come on, baby."
6131,20,1,20,"Marshall: Come on, come on, come on."
6132,20,1,20,"Todd: Hello, Marshall. Lily."
6133,20,1,20,Marshall: Todd. Valerie. Stairs.
6134,20,1,20,The Bar
6135,20,1,20,Lily: I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.
6136,20,1,20,Marshall: It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.
6137,20,1,20,Robin: What?
6138,20,1,20,Marshall: You're a wonder.
6139,20,1,20,Ted: Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.
6140,20,1,20,Robin: How are you going to get everything done?
6141,20,1,20,"Lily: Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist."
6142,20,1,20,Ted from 2030: Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.
6143,20,1,20,[FLASHBACK]
6144,20,1,20,Ted: Was it...?
6145,20,1,20,Robin: It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.
6146,20,1,20,[END OF FLASHBACK]
6147,20,1,20,"Lily: Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations."
6148,20,1,20,"Marshall: Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now."
6149,20,1,20,"Barney: Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?"
6150,20,1,20,"Lily: Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me."
6151,20,1,20,"Barney: Lil, you know I can't promise that."
6152,20,1,20,At the appartment
6153,20,1,20,"(Lily fell asleep on wedding books, Marshall and Ted enters)"
6154,20,1,20,"Marshall: Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad."
6155,20,1,20,Lily: Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.
6156,20,1,20,"Marshall: Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!"
6157,20,1,20,Lily: Who?
6158,20,1,20,Marshall: The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.
6159,20,1,20,"Ted: I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great."
6160,20,1,20,"Lily: John ""Bonzo"" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?"
6161,20,1,20,"Ted: Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago."
6162,20,1,20,"Lily: Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition."
6163,20,1,20,"Marshall: Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands."
6164,20,1,20,"Lily: Well, then... I have to say no."
6165,20,1,20,"Marshall: Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday."
6166,20,1,20,"Lily: Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?"
6167,20,1,20,Marshall: Let me check their Website.
6168,20,1,20,Lily: What?
6169,20,1,20,"Ted: Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing."
6170,20,1,20,"Lily: Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?"
6171,20,1,20,Ted: Wow.
6172,20,1,20,(Barney enters)
6173,20,1,20,Barney: Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.
6174,20,1,20,Lily: We already have a caterer.
6175,20,1,20,"Barney: Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a..."
6176,20,1,20,Marshall: It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.
6177,20,1,20,Lily: A prom? Can... can we go to that?
6178,20,1,20,"Marshall: Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch."
6179,20,1,20,[11 secondes later...]
6180,20,1,20,"Lily: Yeah. No, they won't."
6181,20,1,20,Marshall: Why not?
6182,20,1,20,Lily: 'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.
6183,20,1,20,"Barney: No sweat, we'll just sneak in."
6184,20,1,20,Marshall: We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.
6185,20,1,20,"Lily: Yes, we are. It's the only way."
6186,20,1,20,"Ted: You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped."
6187,20,1,20,"Lily: It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything."
6188,20,1,20,Barney: Well...

6190,20,1,20,The Bar
6191,20,1,20,"Ted from 2030: And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom."
6192,20,1,20,Robin: I'll go with you.
6193,20,1,20,Lily: Really?
6194,20,1,20,Robin: Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.
6195,20,1,20,Barney: Lesbian.
6196,20,1,20,"Robin: The cough is supposed to cover the ""lesbian."""
6197,20,1,20,"Barney: No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate."
6198,20,1,20,Lily: Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?
6199,20,1,20,"Barney: Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got ""statutory"" written all over your body."
6200,20,1,20,"Ted: Hey, why don't we all go?"
6201,20,1,20,Robin: I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.
6202,20,1,20,"Ted: Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?"
6203,20,1,20,Marshall: Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.
6204,20,1,20,Ted: Yeah.
6205,20,1,20,"Marshall: 'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw."
6206,20,1,20,"Barney: Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later."
6207,20,1,20,At the appartment
6208,20,1,20,"Lily: All right, what do you think?"
6209,20,1,20,Barney: Horrible.
6210,20,1,20,Lily: You're gonna make such a great dad.
6211,20,1,20,"Barney: You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home."
6212,20,1,20,"Lily: Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have..."
6213,20,1,20,"Robin: Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it."
6214,20,1,20,Lily: All right.
6215,20,1,20,"Barney: That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!"
6216,20,1,20,In the bedroom
6217,20,1,20,"Robin: I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough."
6218,20,1,20,Lily: I didn't know I still had this.
6219,20,1,20,Robin: What?
6220,20,1,20,Lily: The dress I wore to my actual prom.
6221,20,1,20,[FLASHBACK]
6222,20,1,20,"Scooter: Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul."
6223,20,1,20,"Lily: Aw, you look great, too, Scooter."
6224,20,1,20,Scooter: So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in!
6225,20,1,20,"Lily: Oh, disco! I am so happy for you."
6226,20,1,20,"Scooter: You mean happy for us, right, babe?"
6227,20,1,20,"Lily: Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday."
6228,20,1,20,"Scooter: No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday."
6229,20,1,20,[END OF FLASHBACK]
6230,20,1,20,"Barney: Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing."
6231,20,1,20,"Robin: No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore..."
6232,20,1,20,Barney: Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.
6233,20,1,20,Lily: Aw. Sweet. Thank you.
6234,20,1,20,"Barney: Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?"
6235,20,1,20,"Robin: No. I've never been to prom before, okay?"
6236,20,1,20,Lily: We got to go. See ya.
6237,20,1,20,"Ted: Bye, have fun. See you."
6238,20,1,20,"(Lily, Robin and Barney leave)"
6239,20,1,20,"Marshall: They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?"
6240,20,1,20,"Ted: So, what, we ready for tonight?"
6241,20,1,20,Marshall: Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.
6242,20,1,20,Ted: Shot of Jim Beam?
6243,20,1,20,Marshall: Yeah.
6244,20,1,20,Ted: Yes!
6245,20,1,20,Marshall: And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.
6246,20,1,20,Ted: What?!
6247,20,1,20,"Marshall: I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is."
6248,20,1,20,"Ted: Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad."
6249,20,1,20,"Marshall: Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize."
6250,20,1,20,"Ted: Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?"
6251,20,1,20,
6252,20,1,20,Outside the prom
6253,20,1,20,"Lily: Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids."
6254,20,1,20,Robin: Is this gonna work?
6255,20,1,20,"Lily: Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!"
6256,20,1,20,"Security guard: Uh, you're adults."
6257,20,1,20,"Lily: Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and..."
6258,20,1,20,Security guard: And you're just finding a band?
6259,20,1,20,"Barney: Hey, ho, hey!"
6260,20,1,20,"Security guard: I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student."
6261,20,1,20,"Lily: Wow. ""Ma'am?"" Check and mate."
6262,20,1,20,"Barney: It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?"
6263,20,1,20,"Robin: Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?"
6264,20,1,20,Boy: We don't have that kind of money.
6265,20,1,20,Robin: For free.
6266,20,1,20,"Boy: Oh, hell yeah!"
6267,20,1,20,"Robin: Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily."
6268,20,1,20,Lily: Hi. Shall we?
6269,20,1,20,Boy: Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.
6270,20,1,20,"Robin: Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?"
6271,20,1,20,Barney: Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.
6272,20,1,20,Inside the building
6273,20,1,20,Lily: We're in!
6274,20,1,20,Singer: Thank you. We're going to take a break.
6275,20,1,20,"Lily: Oh, you're kidding me."
6276,20,1,20,"Boy #1: Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off?"
6277,20,1,20,"Robin: Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup."
6278,20,1,20,"Boy #1: Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them."
6279,20,1,20,"Robin: Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys."
6280,20,1,20,"Lily: Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play ""Good Feeling"" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play ""Good Feeling"" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?"
6281,20,1,20,"Man: Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song."
6282,20,1,20,"Boy #1: So, you buzzing, baby?"
6283,20,1,20,Robin: My phlegm feels looser.
6284,20,1,20,At the appartment
6285,20,1,20,"Ted: This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?"
6286,20,1,20,Marshall: You know it.
6287,20,1,20,"Ted: I'd have your back, too."
6288,20,1,20,Marshall: That's cool.
6289,20,1,20,"Ted: What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker."
6290,20,1,20,"Marshall: Okay, Ted. (His phone starts rigging) Hello."
6291,20,1,20,"Robin: Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for ""Good Feeling"" and bring it out here, like, now."
6292,20,1,20,Marshall: Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?
6293,20,1,20,Ted: Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.
6294,20,1,20,"Robin: Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us."
6295,20,1,20,Ted: What'd she say? What'd she say?
6296,20,1,20,"Robin: He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes."
6297,20,1,20,"Marshall: Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come."
6298,20,1,20,At the prom
6299,20,1,20,"Robin: All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?"
6300,20,1,20,Lily: There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.
6301,20,1,20,[FLASHBACK]
6302,20,1,20,Scooter: How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.
6303,20,1,20,Lily: I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.
6304,20,1,20,"Scooter: What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!"
6305,20,1,20,"Lily: Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us."
6306,20,1,20,"Scooter: You're, you're breaking up with me?"
6307,20,1,20,"Lily: There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain."
6308,20,1,20,"Scooter: I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby."
6309,20,1,20,Lily: Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!
6310,20,1,20,[END OF FLASHBACK]
6311,20,1,20,"Boy #2: It's just one dance, God!"
6312,20,1,20,Lily: What?
6313,20,1,20,"Robin: Well, we did promise them one dance."
6314,20,1,20,"Lily: Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?"
6315,20,1,20,"Andrew: Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something."
6316,20,1,20,"Lily: No, you won't."
6317,20,1,20,Andrew: I won't?
6318,20,1,20,"Lily: No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering ""Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?"""
6319,20,1,20,Andrew: Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend?
6320,20,1,20,"Boy #1: So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight?"
6321,20,1,20,"Robin: Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight."
6322,20,1,20,"Giant Turtle: Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me."
6323,20,1,20,Ted: Okay.
6324,20,1,20,Giant Turtle: How'd you get in here?
6325,20,1,20,"Marshall: What's it to you, giant turtle?"
6326,20,1,20,"Giant Turtle: It's me, Barney."
6327,20,1,20,"Marshall: Oh, hey. Where's Lily?"
6328,20,1,20,Barney: She's in the bathroom.
6329,20,1,20,"Marshall: Wait here, I should go talk to the band."
6330,20,1,20,Ted: All right.
6331,20,1,20,Barney: How did you guys get in here?
6332,20,1,20,Ted: We just snuck in the back.
6333,20,1,20,Barney: You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.
6334,20,1,20,Ted: But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.
6335,20,1,20,"Marshall: Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily?"
6336,20,1,20,"Andrew: Your fiancée? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble."
6337,20,1,20,"Marshall: Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but..."
6338,20,1,20,"Andrew: No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me."
6339,20,1,20,"Marshall: Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away."
6340,20,1,20,Andrew: Yah! Nunchaku!
6341,20,1,20,Lily: I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.
6342,20,1,20,"Robin: I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?"
6343,20,1,20,Lily: Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.
6344,20,1,20,[FLASHBACK]
6345,20,1,20,"Lily: I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?"
6346,20,1,20,Man: Marshall.
6347,20,1,20,"Lily: Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates."
6348,20,1,20,Marshall: Yeah.
6349,20,1,20,Lily: It works.
6350,20,1,20,Marshall: Violent Femmes. I love this song.

6352,20,1,20,[END OF FLASHBACK]
6353,20,1,20,"Lily: I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it."
6354,20,1,20,"Robin: Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?"
6355,20,1,20,Lily: Yeah.
6356,20,1,20,"Robin: And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?"
6357,20,1,20,"Lily: Yeah. So field hockey, huh?"
6358,20,1,20,Robin: Shut up.
6359,20,1,20,Outside
6360,20,1,20,"Security guard #1: Trespassing, assaulting a minor. This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000."
6361,20,1,20,"Security guard #2: We can have you guys arrested, you know that?"
6362,20,1,20,"Ted: Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here."
6363,20,1,20,Marshall: I totally could have taken that kid.
6364,20,1,20,"Ted: Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so..."
6365,20,1,20,"Marshall: Well, I don't need it, but thanks."
6366,20,1,20,"Ted: Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome."
6367,20,1,20,"Marshall: No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song."
6368,20,1,20,Security guards: Absolutely not.
6369,20,1,20,"Barney: You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?"
6370,20,1,20,"(Barney takes the head of the turtle, and starts running away)"
6371,20,1,20,Security guard #1: Hey!
6372,20,1,20,"Ted: You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick."
6373,20,1,20,Singer: This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.
6374,20,1,20,Ted: So how was your first prom?
6375,20,1,20,"Robin: You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl."
6376,20,1,20,"Ted: So, basically, it was a prom."
6377,20,1,20,"Robin: Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way."
6378,20,1,20,Ted: I'll take what I can get.
6379,20,1,20,"Barney: And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club."
6380,20,1,20,"Marshall: So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song."
6381,20,1,20,"Lily: Yeah, it's good."
6382,20,1,20,"Marshall: Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months."
6383,20,1,20,Lily: Two months.
6384,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: Kids, life is a dark road. You never really know what's up ahead. One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28."

6386,21,1,21,"Waitress: And for the birthday boy, lasagna."
6387,21,1,21,Ted: Thank you.

6389,21,1,21,"Ted: 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it."
6390,21,1,21,"Lily: Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate."
6391,21,1,21,"Ted: All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?"
6392,21,1,21,"Robin: Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this."
6393,21,1,21,"Barney: I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted."
6394,21,1,21,"Marshall: You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy."
6395,21,1,21,"Ted: Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney."
6396,21,1,21,"Marshall: Oy, gevalt."

6400,21,1,21,"Barney: Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God."
6401,21,1,21,Woman: What?
6402,21,1,21,Barney: Oh! Call an ambulance!
6403,21,1,21,Woman: What's going on?
6404,21,1,21,"Barney: Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk."
6405,21,1,21,Waitress: Is she okay?
6406,21,1,21,"Barney: I'm serious, call 911."
6407,21,1,21,Woman: What's wrong? What's the matter?
6408,21,1,21,"Barney: Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!"
6409,21,1,21,"Robin: You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time."
6410,21,1,21,Ted: Wait for it.
6411,21,1,21,"Lily: 28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh."
6412,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad. Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story. But I'll get to that later."
6413,21,1,21,"Lily: Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?"
6414,21,1,21,Ted: Nope. I hit the snooze button.
6415,21,1,21,Robin: And here come the paramedics.

6417,21,1,21,Paramedic: What is going on?!
6418,21,1,21,Barney: I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.
6419,21,1,21,Woman: What are you talking about?
6420,21,1,21,Barney: You've had a terrible fall.
6421,21,1,21,"Woman: No, I haven't."
6422,21,1,21,Barney: Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?
6423,21,1,21,All: Give him your number.
6424,21,1,21,"Barney: Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me."
6425,21,1,21,All: Give him your number.
6426,21,1,21,Barney: What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.
6427,21,1,21,Woman: All right!
6428,21,1,21,Barney: It works!
6429,21,1,21,Marshall: I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
6430,21,1,21,Robin: Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
6431,21,1,21,"Barney: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good."
6432,21,1,21,"Ted: I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect."
6433,21,1,21,"Lily: Well, what's perfect?"
6434,21,1,21,Ted: It's not like I have a list.
6435,21,1,21,"Robin: Oh, yes, you do."
6436,21,1,21,"Ted: Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl..."
6437,21,1,21,Lily: That's not hard. I know at least...
6438,21,1,21,"Ted: I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies."
6439,21,1,21,Marshall: Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.
6440,21,1,21,"Ted: Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky."
6441,21,1,21,Lily: You're never going to find this girl.
6442,21,1,21,Ted: Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
6443,21,1,21,"Marshall: So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?"
6444,21,1,21,Ted: That's the plan.
6445,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it."
6446,21,1,21,At the appartment
6447,21,1,21,"Ted: Whoa, you're up early."
6448,21,1,21,"Lily: Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes."
6449,21,1,21,Ted: Does Marshall know?
6450,21,1,21,Lily: He's still sound asleep.
6451,21,1,21,"Marshall: Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up."
6452,21,1,21,"Ted: Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?"
6453,21,1,21,"Marshall: Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday."
6454,21,1,21,"Ted: God, why didn't you throw it away?"
6455,21,1,21,Lily: I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.
6456,21,1,21,Marshall: Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.
6457,21,1,21,"Lily: What's wrong, baby?"
6458,21,1,21,Marshall: This is the high point of my day.
6459,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it."
6460,21,1,21,Barney's office
6461,21,1,21,"Marshall: Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms."
6462,21,1,21,Barney: Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.
6463,21,1,21,"Marshall: I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do."
6464,21,1,21,"Barney: Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs."
6465,21,1,21,Marshall: So?
6466,21,1,21,"Barney: So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture."
6467,21,1,21,Marshall: Oh! Sweet Lord.
6468,21,1,21,Barney: And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.
6469,21,1,21,Marshall: Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?
6470,21,1,21,Barney: Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.
6471,21,1,21,Marshall: You?
6472,21,1,21,"Barney: Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great."
6473,21,1,21,Marshall: What?
6474,21,1,21,"Barney: Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late."
6475,21,1,21,Marshall: This is stupid.
6476,21,1,21,"Barney: Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant."
6477,21,1,21,"Marshall: This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do."
6478,21,1,21,"Barney: Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him."
6479,21,1,21,"Tracy: Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer..."
6480,21,1,21,"Marshall: I get it. Thank you, Tracy."
6481,21,1,21,At the appartment
6482,21,1,21,Ted: Hello?
6483,21,1,21,Man: Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?
6484,21,1,21,Ted: Speaking.
6485,21,1,21,"Man: Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago."
6486,21,1,21,"Ted: Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match."
6487,21,1,21,"Bob: Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate."
6488,21,1,21,At Love Solutions
6489,21,1,21,Ted: I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?
6490,21,1,21,"Bob: Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am."
6491,21,1,21,Ted: So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?
6492,21,1,21,Bob: There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.
6493,21,1,21,"Ted: No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged."
6494,21,1,21,Bob: She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.
6495,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl."
6496,21,1,21,"Ted: All right, fine. Set it up."
6497,21,1,21,Barney's office
6498,21,1,21,"Marshall: You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?"
6499,21,1,21,Barney: Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.
6500,21,1,21,Marshall: Tastes normal to me.
6501,21,1,21,"Barney: That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield."
6502,21,1,21,"Marshall: Oh, God!"
6503,21,1,21,Barney: It got me as well.
6504,21,1,21,"Marshall: Well, then why did you have me drink it?!"
6505,21,1,21,Barney: Because now... you're in.
6506,21,1,21,Marshall: Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that b*st*rd pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?
6507,21,1,21,"Barney: Yeah, it's probably a good idea."
6508,21,1,21,In a bar
6509,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started..."
6510,21,1,21,"(Ted's phone starts ringing, he picks up)"
6511,21,1,21,Ted: Lily?
6512,21,1,21,"Lily: Hey, Ted, are you busy?"
6513,21,1,21,Ted: Um... yes.
6514,21,1,21,"Lily: Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?"
6515,21,1,21,Ted: What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?
6516,21,1,21,"Lily: Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?"
6517,21,1,21,"Ted: I can't, I'm waiting..."
6518,21,1,21,"Lily: Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!"
6519,21,1,21,"Ted: Come on, Lily."
6520,21,1,21,Lily: But you see my point.
6521,21,1,21,"Ted: All right, stay there. I'm on my way."
6522,21,1,21,At Duchess County
6523,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere."
6524,21,1,21,"Lily: Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?"
6525,21,1,21,Ted: Yes.
6526,21,1,21,Lily: And was she okay about pushing it back?
6527,21,1,21,Ted: Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?
6528,21,1,21,Lily: You can never tell Marshall.
6529,21,1,21,Ted: I won't.
6530,21,1,21,Lily: Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
6531,21,1,21,Ted: I swear on Luke and Leia.
6532,21,1,21,"Lily: About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary."
6533,21,1,21,Ted: Did you talk to Marshall about it?
6534,21,1,21,"Lily: He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man..."
6535,21,1,21,Ted: That was you? Awesome!
6536,21,1,21,"Lily: I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship."
6537,21,1,21,Ted: Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.
6538,21,1,21,"Lily: San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven."
6539,21,1,21,Ted: You don't want to get married.
6540,21,1,21,Lily: Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
6541,21,1,21,"Ted: Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means."
6542,21,1,21,"Lily: Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid."
6543,21,1,21,Ted: I don't think you're stupid.
6544,21,1,21,Lily: I love Marshall.
6545,21,1,21,Ted: I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.
6546,21,1,21,Lily: But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
6547,21,1,21,
6548,21,1,21,Barney's office
6549,21,1,21,Marshall: So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
6550,21,1,21,At Duchess County
6551,21,1,21,Ted: All done.
6552,21,1,21,"Lily: Ted, let's go to New Haven."
6553,21,1,21,"Ted: Lily, don't do this to yourself."
6554,21,1,21,"Lily: I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure."
6555,21,1,21,"Ted: No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake."
6556,21,1,21,"Lily: Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, ""Yep. That was a mistake."" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?"
6557,21,1,21,"Ted: I don't know. You said ""mistake"" a lot. Lily, don't do this."
6558,21,1,21,"Lily: Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this."
6559,21,1,21,"Ted: Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing. (He calls Barney) Hey, I need a big favor."
6560,21,1,21,"Barney: Anything, bro."
6561,21,1,21,Ted: I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
6562,21,1,21,Barney: No.
6563,21,1,21,Ted: It's kind of an emergency.
6564,21,1,21,Barney: What are you doing in Duchess County?
6565,21,1,21,Ted: Apple picking. Can you just get up here?
6566,21,1,21,"Barney: I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped."
6567,21,1,21,Marshall: Is that Ted?
6568,21,1,21,Barney: Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.
6569,21,1,21,Marshall: Don't you have a big date tonight?
6570,21,1,21,"Ted: Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do."
6571,21,1,21,Marshall: So what are you doing in Duchess County?
6572,21,1,21,Ted: Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!
6573,21,1,21,"Marshall: Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you."
6574,21,1,21,Ted: No!
6575,21,1,21,"Marshall: Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero."
6576,21,1,21,"Ted: No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County."
6577,21,1,21,Marshall: So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?
6578,21,1,21,Ted: Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.
6579,21,1,21,Barney's office
6580,21,1,21,"Barney: Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield."
6581,21,1,21,"Marshall: You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there."
6582,21,1,21,Barney: You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
6583,21,1,21,"Marshall: Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?"
6584,21,1,21,Tracy: Taking off for the night.
6585,21,1,21,"Barney: Thanks, Tracy."
6586,21,1,21,Tracy: Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
6587,21,1,21,Barney: Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?
6588,21,1,21,Marshall: No.
6589,21,1,21,Barney: That would have been bad.
6590,21,1,21,Marshall: Horrible.
6591,21,1,21,At Duchess County
6592,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home."
6593,21,1,21,"Robin: Need a ride, cowboy?"
6594,21,1,21,Ted: Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.
6595,21,1,21,"Robin: Hmm, too bad. I got candy."
6596,21,1,21,Ted: Candy?!
6597,21,1,21,Robin: So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
6598,21,1,21,Ted: Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
6599,21,1,21,"Robin: Oh, come on."
6600,21,1,21,Ted: I like your hat.
6601,21,1,21,Robin: Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.
6602,21,1,21,"Ted: Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine."
6603,21,1,21,"Robin: Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took ""highlights"" to mean, ""I want to look like a tiger,"" hence the hat."
6604,21,1,21,Ted: Oh. I gotta see this.
6605,21,1,21,Robin: No way.
6606,21,1,21,Ted: Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!
6607,21,1,21,"Robin: So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?"
6608,21,1,21,"Ted: Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me."
6609,21,1,21,"Robin: Wow, I'm 28. Hmm."
6610,21,1,21,"Ted: Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check."
6611,21,1,21,"Robin: I read that. More like ""Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."""
6612,21,1,21,"Ted: You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying."
6613,21,1,21,Robin: We're not indoors. We're in a van.
6614,21,1,21,Ted: Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
6615,21,1,21,Robin: Never. What else?
6616,21,1,21,Ted: She loves lasagna.
6617,21,1,21,Robin: Barf.
6618,21,1,21,"Ted: You know, I am sensing a pattern here."
6619,21,1,21,Robin: What else?
6620,21,1,21,"Ted: Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check."
6621,21,1,21,Robin: And she's looking to get married and have kids?
6622,21,1,21,Ted: Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.
6623,21,1,21,"Robin: Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids."
6624,21,1,21,Ted: Really? You don't want kids?
6625,21,1,21,"Robin: You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early."
6626,21,1,21,"Ted: Hey, thanks for picking me up."
6627,21,1,21,Robin: Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.
6628,21,1,21,Ted: Thanks.
6629,21,1,21,"Robin: All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do."
6630,21,1,21,Ted: You're going to show me your hair?
6631,21,1,21,"Robin: Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair."
6632,21,1,21,Ted: You just made my night.
6633,21,1,21,Robin: Go.
6634,21,1,21,"(Ted gets out of the van et watch Robin leaving. He sees himself at his wedding, except Robin is not the bride)"
6635,21,1,21,At the appartment
6636,21,1,21,"Marshall: Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude."
6637,21,1,21,"Ted: Hey, guys."
6638,21,1,21,Lily: Hi.
6639,21,1,21,"Ted: Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?"
6640,21,1,21,"Lily: Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it."
6641,21,1,21,Ted: You think you might want to... drink the milk?
6642,21,1,21,"Lily: No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk."
6643,21,1,21,"Marshall: Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?"
6644,21,1,21,Ted: I didn't go.
6645,21,1,21,Marshall: What? Why?
6646,21,1,21,Ted: I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.
6647,21,1,21,Marshall: Why? She sounds perfect.
6648,21,1,21,Ted: I don't want perfect. I want Robin.
6649,21,1,21,"Marshall: Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake."
6650,21,1,21,Ted: Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.
6651,21,1,21,Marshall: Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...
6652,21,1,21,"Ted from 2030: Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway."
6653,21,1,21,[FLASHBACKS]
6654,21,1,21,"Lily: Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate."
6655,21,1,21,"Ted: Hey, is this milk any good?"
6656,21,1,21,[END OF FLASHBACKS]
6657,21,1,21,Ted from 2030: Even really really dumb mistakes.
6658,22,1,22,Ted from 2030: It was May of 2006 in New York City and life was good. But everything was about to change.
6659,22,1,22,At the Bar
6660,22,1,22,Ted: So... what do you think?
6661,22,1,22,"Barney: Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you."
6662,22,1,22,Ted: But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?
6663,22,1,22,Marshall: Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?
6664,22,1,22,"Ted: Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. (Barney slaps him) Ow! What the hell?"
6665,22,1,22,Barney: That wasn't me. That was the universe.
6666,22,1,22,"Ted from 2030: The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm."
6667,22,1,22,At Metro News One
6668,22,1,22,"Weather man: And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin?"
6669,22,1,22,"Robin: Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend."
6670,22,1,22,"Sandy: Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck."
6671,22,1,22,Robin: Guess we'll have to take a rain check.
6672,22,1,22,"Sandy: And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York."
6673,22,1,22,Robin: Have a great night.
6674,22,1,22,"Man: And, we're clear."
6675,22,1,22,"Sandy: Bummer. I was hoping to finally have s*x with you this weekend, Scherbotsky."
6676,22,1,22,"Robin: Well, I'd give you the ""I don't date coworkers"" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now."
6677,22,1,22,"Sandy: Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing."
6678,22,1,22,At the Bar
6679,22,1,22,"Marshall: Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, ""enough""?"
6680,22,1,22,"Ted: One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever."
6681,22,1,22,"Lily: So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?"
6682,22,1,22,"Ted: I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment."
6683,22,1,22,"Barney: I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name..."
6684,22,1,22,(Lily slaps him)
6685,22,1,22,"Lily: Universe. So, this plan you speak of?"
6686,22,1,22,Ted: Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.
6687,22,1,22,"Marshall: Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?"
6688,22,1,22,At Robin's appartment
6689,22,1,22,"(Ted is waiting for Robin, with a small orchestra)"
6690,22,1,22,Ted: She should be here any second.
6691,22,1,22,"Musician: Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?"
6692,22,1,22,"Ted: Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just..."
6693,22,1,22,"(On the other side of the entry door, Robin is looking for her keyes)"
6694,22,1,22,Robin: Damn it.
6695,22,1,22,(Ted sees the keyes on the coffee table)
6696,22,1,22,Lily: Hello.
6697,22,1,22,"Robin: Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key."
6698,22,1,22,Lily: Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?
6699,22,1,22,"Robin: Yes, I gave it to you."
6700,22,1,22,"Lily: Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it."
6701,22,1,22,"Robin: Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith."
6702,22,1,22,"Lily: No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock."
6703,22,1,22,"Robin: Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained."
6704,22,1,22,(Marshall comes in their appartment andlistens to the voice mails)
6705,22,1,22,"Voice mail: Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye."
6706,22,1,22,"Lily: Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?"
6707,22,1,22,Marshall: Summer fellowship?
6708,22,1,22,Robin: Just knock. Okay.
6709,22,1,22,"(Robin knocks, and Ted opens the entry door)"
6710,22,1,22,Ted: Hi.
6711,22,1,22,Robin: Hi.
6712,22,1,22,"Ted: Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?"
6713,22,1,22,Robin: Yes. No. I don't know.
6714,22,1,22,Ted: Those are the three options.
6715,22,1,22,"Robin: Ted, this is so..."
6716,22,1,22,Ted: I know.
6717,22,1,22,"Robin: I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee."
6718,22,1,22,"Ted: Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait."
6719,22,1,22,(Robin goes to the loo)
6720,22,1,22,"Musician: Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza."
6721,22,1,22,"Ted: No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here."
6722,22,1,22,Musician: Sure. We're not getting any pizza.
6723,22,1,22,(Robin comes back)
6724,22,1,22,Robin: Okay. Let's talk.
6725,22,1,22,"Ted: Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?"
6726,22,1,22,"Robin: Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. (The musicians leave) You're crazy."
6727,22,1,22,Ted: Right. Come on.
6728,22,1,22,"Robin: It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again."
6729,22,1,22,Ted: I know. But... come on...
6730,22,1,22,"Robin: And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this."
6731,22,1,22,"Ted: Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious."
6732,22,1,22,"Robin: I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping."
6733,22,1,22,Ted: I thought that thing was canceled.
6734,22,1,22,"Robin: Well, it's back on."
6735,22,1,22,Ted: Since when?
6736,22,1,22,Robin: Since like an hour ago.
6737,22,1,22,[FLASHBACK]
6738,22,1,22,Weather man:..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin?
6739,22,1,22,"Sandy: Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York."
6740,22,1,22,Man: And we're clear.
6741,22,1,22,Robin: You're leaving?
6742,22,1,22,Sandy: There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.
6743,22,1,22,"Robin: Oh, congratulations."
6744,22,1,22,Sandy: Congratulations yourself.
6745,22,1,22,Robin: What do you mean?
6746,22,1,22,"Sandy: Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised."
6747,22,1,22,"Robin: Wow. Thanks. And, yes."
6748,22,1,22,"Sandy: Yes, what?"
6749,22,1,22,"Robin: Yes, let's go get dinner."
6750,22,1,22,Sandy: How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.
6751,22,1,22,[END OF FLASHBACK]
6752,22,1,22,"Ted: Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing."
6753,22,1,22,"Robin: Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip."
6754,22,1,22,Ted: Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?
6755,22,1,22,Robin: I don't-I don't know.
6756,22,1,22,"Ted: So, what? You actually like this guy now?"
6757,22,1,22,Robin: I don't know.
6758,22,1,22,Ted: Are you gonna hook up with him?
6759,22,1,22,Robin: I don't know.
6760,22,1,22,"Ted: Yes, you do."
6761,22,1,22,"Robin: No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do."
6762,22,1,22,Ted: I don't plan out every...
6763,22,1,22,"Robin: Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, ""Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together."
6764,22,1,22,"Ted: Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake."
6765,22,1,22,Robin: I need to think about this.
6766,22,1,22,Ted: Fine.
6767,22,1,22,"Robin: No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer."
6768,22,1,22,"Ted: If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that."
6769,22,1,22,"Robin: Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no."
6770,22,1,22,Ted: Then I guess it's not meant to be.
6771,22,1,22,At the Bar
6772,22,1,22,"Barney: Nice try, buddy."
6773,22,1,22,Good hustle out there.
6774,22,1,22,Marshall: Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.
6775,22,1,22,Ted: Screw that. This ain't over.
6776,22,1,22,"Marshall: Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said..."
6777,22,1,22,"Ted: I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be."
6778,22,1,22,"(Ted goes away, Barney is following him)"
6779,22,1,22,Lily: Unpause?
6780,22,1,22,Marshall: Unpause.
6781,22,1,22,"Ted from 2030: Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days."
6782,22,1,22,Marshall: A painting fellowship?
6783,22,1,22,Lily: I was never going to take it.
6784,22,1,22,Marshall: In California?
6785,22,1,22,Lily: I was never going to take it.
6786,22,1,22,"Barney: Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend."
6787,22,1,22,"Ted: Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is."
6788,22,1,22,Barney: What are you talking about?
6789,22,1,22,Ted: I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!
6790,22,1,22,"Barney: Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time."
6791,22,1,22,"Ted: Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?"
6792,22,1,22,Barney: Yeah.
6793,22,1,22,Ted: Are you still in touch with her?
6794,22,1,22,"Barney: Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having s*x, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!"
6795,22,1,22,"Ted: Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance."
6796,22,1,22,"Barney: Did you just say a ""rain dance""?"
6797,22,1,22,Ted: Yes.
6798,22,1,22,Barney: A rain dance.
6799,22,1,22,Ted: Yes.
6800,22,1,22,Barney: A dance to make it rain.
6801,22,1,22,Ted: Yes. (Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him) We're finding Penelope!
6802,22,1,22,"Barney: No, we are not!"
6803,22,1,22,"Ted: Yes, we are!"
6804,22,1,22,"Barney: Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!"
6805,22,1,22,(They both leave the Bar)
6806,22,1,22,
6807,22,1,22,Inside a library
6808,22,1,22,Penelope: Why the hell should I help you?
6809,22,1,22,"Barney: Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship."
6810,22,1,22,"Penelope: We had s*x twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?"
6811,22,1,22,Barney: Twice!
6812,22,1,22,"Penelope: Barney, there is no way..."
6813,22,1,22,Barney: Shh!
6814,22,1,22,"Penelope: Seriously, come on."
6815,22,1,22,"Ted: Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend."
6816,22,1,22,Penelope: Why?
6817,22,1,22,Ted: There's this girl...
6818,22,1,22,"Penelope: ""There's this girl."" You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid."
6819,22,1,22,"Ted: Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please."
6820,22,1,22,"Penelope: This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?"
6821,22,1,22,Ted: Absolutely.
6822,22,1,22,Penelope: Kind of like Barney?
6823,22,1,22,Ted: Kind of.
6824,22,1,22,Barney: Hey.
6825,22,1,22,Penelope: You hit on my mom!
6826,22,1,22,Barney: We weren't exclusive!
6827,22,1,22,Penelope: I'm in.
6828,22,1,22,Ted from 2030: And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.
6829,22,1,22,On top of the roof of Ted's building
6830,22,1,22,(Barney is drinking a beer while Penelope is teaching Ted how to dance a rain dance)
6831,22,1,22,Penelope: Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.
6832,22,1,22,"Barney: Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position."
6833,22,1,22,Penelope: I will throw you off this roof.
6834,22,1,22,Barney: There's so much of your mom in you.
6835,22,1,22,Robin is at the veterinary with her dog
6836,22,1,22,Robin: And she's been throwing up ever since.
6837,22,1,22,Veterinary: So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?
6838,22,1,22,"Robin: Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates..."
6839,22,1,22,"Veterinary: Oh, that's so sweet."
6840,22,1,22,"Robin: Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?"
6841,22,1,22,Veterinary: Nobody does that.
6842,22,1,22,Robin: Exactly.
6843,22,1,22,"Veterinary: No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now."
6844,22,1,22,At the appartment
6845,22,1,22,(Marshall and Lily are fighting)
6846,22,1,22,Lily: So you're saying you would forbid me from going?
6847,22,1,22,"Marshall: Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted."
6848,22,1,22,"Lily: Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever."
6849,22,1,22,"Marshall: So now we've gone from ""I was never gonna do it"" to ""I need to do this""? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?"
6850,22,1,22,"Lily: Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it."
6851,22,1,22,"Marshall: I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all."
6852,22,1,22,Lily: Maybe not.
6853,22,1,22,Marshall: Pause.
6854,22,1,22,"Lily: So, are you just, like, starving?"
6855,22,1,22,Marshall: Totally. Red Lobster?
6856,22,1,22,"Lily: Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!"
6857,22,1,22,"Marshall: Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you."
6858,22,1,22,"Lily: I wouldn't dare. (Marshall starts crying) Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it!"
6859,22,1,22,"Waiters: Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy..."
6860,22,1,22,On top of the rooftop of Ted's building
6861,22,1,22,(Ted is dancing)
6862,22,1,22,"Barney: Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad."
6863,22,1,22,"Ted: Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?"
6864,22,1,22,Penelope: I think so.
6865,22,1,22,"Ted: Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?"
6866,22,1,22,Penelope: I think so.
6867,22,1,22,"Ted: Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?"
6868,22,1,22,Penelope: No.
6869,22,1,22,Ted: No?
6870,22,1,22,"Penelope: I've read extensively on the subject: firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological..."
6871,22,1,22,Ted: Have you ever seen a rain dance?
6872,22,1,22,Penelope: I've seen a film strip.
6873,22,1,22,"Ted: Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves."
6874,22,1,22,"Penelope: What do you mean ""we,"" white man?"
6875,22,1,22,At the appartment
6876,22,1,22,"Marshall: How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge."
6877,22,1,22,Lily: I think there's still one left.
6878,22,1,22,Marshall: Dibs.
6879,22,1,22,Lily: Unpause?
6880,22,1,22,Marshall: Unpause.
6881,22,1,22,Lily: Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.
6882,22,1,22,"Marshall: I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't."
6883,22,1,22,Lily: Why not?
6884,22,1,22,"Marshall: Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?"
6885,22,1,22,Lily: Marshall...
6886,22,1,22,"Marshall: 'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out."
6887,22,1,22,"Lily: Marshall, I love you."
6888,22,1,22,Marshall: Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?
6889,22,1,22,Lily: Pause.
6890,22,1,22,"Marshall: No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!"
6891,22,1,22,Lily: Pause!
6892,22,1,22,"Marshall: Why do you want me to pause?! (She throws herself on him et kisses him) That's just a great use of the pause function, baby."
6893,22,1,22,Lily: Thank you.
6894,22,1,22,On top of the rooftop of Ted's building
6895,22,1,22,"Barney: Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?"
6896,22,1,22,Ted: A rain dance.
6897,22,1,22,"Barney: Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants."
6898,22,1,22,"Ted: Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour."
6899,22,1,22,Barney: These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!
6900,22,1,22,Ted: Yeah. I know that.
6901,22,1,22,"Barney: Well, then why are you doing this?"
6902,22,1,22,"Ted: Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!"
6903,22,1,22,(Rain starts falling down)
6904,22,1,22,"Barney: Oh, come on!"
6905,22,1,22,In the street
6906,22,1,22,Weather man: Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.
6907,22,1,22,At the Bar
6908,22,1,22,Barney: How about that? He did it.
6909,22,1,22,(Barney and Penelope kiss)
6910,22,1,22,In front of Robin's building
6911,22,1,22,(Ted goes out of a taxi et calls Robin while the rain is still falling down)
6912,22,1,22,"Ted: Robin! Hey, Robin! (Robin opens up her window) Oh, thank God you're here!"
6913,22,1,22,Robin: My camping trip got rained out.
6914,22,1,22,Ted: I know. I'm sorry.
6915,22,1,22,Robin: It's not your fault.
6916,22,1,22,"Ted: Yeah, it is. Come down here."
6917,22,1,22,Robin: It's pouring. You come up.
6918,22,1,22,"Ted: No, you have to come down here."
6919,22,1,22,Robin: Why?
6920,22,1,22,"Ted: Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!"
6921,22,1,22,"Robin: I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up."
6922,22,1,22,"Ted: I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!"
6923,22,1,22,"(She closes her window, opens her entry door et finds Ted there)"
6924,22,1,22,Robin: I was gonna...
6925,22,1,22,Ted: I know.
6926,22,1,22,(They kiss)
6927,22,1,22,"Ted from 2030: And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed."
6928,22,1,22,"(Ted arrives in front of his building and finds Marshall sitting down the stairs, with Lily's engagement ring in his hand)"
6929,23,2,1,Year 2030
6930,23,2,1,"Ted: OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn."
6931,23,2,1,Ted's daughter:Can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year
6932,23,2,1,"Ted: Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story."
6933,23,2,1,Ted's son: Can I go to the bathroom?
6934,23,2,1,"Ted: No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. (In 2006, Ted and Robin are kissing after the rain dance) In fact, day one was amazing. I'd finally gotten together with Robin. But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring)."
6935,23,2,1,"Year 2006 (Before Ted arrives, Marshall and Lily are in the apartment, arguing)"
6936,23,2,1,Marshall: So that's it? We're breaking up?
6937,23,2,1,"Lily: Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while."
6938,23,2,1,"Marshall: For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again."
6939,23,2,1,"Later, Ted joined Marshall."
6940,23,2,1,Marshall: I should call her.
6941,23,2,1,"Ted: No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face."
6942,23,2,1,Marshall: You're a good friend Ted.
6943,23,2,1,(Robin arrives.)
6944,23,2,1,"Robin: Hey! So, did you hear the big news?"
6945,23,2,1,"Ted: You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows."
6946,23,2,1,Robin: Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?
6947,23,2,1,"Marshall: Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back."
6948,23,2,1,(Barney arrives.)
6949,23,2,1,"Barney: I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry."
6950,23,2,1,Marshall: Thanks.
6951,23,2,1,Barney: I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?
6952,23,2,1,Marshall: Sure.
6953,23,2,1,"Barney: For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting ""What's up New York?"" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... (While he's speaking, Barney looks at Ted and then at Robin). Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!"
6954,23,2,1,CREDIT TITLES
6955,23,2,1,"Ted from 2030: One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning (Ted and Robin are making out) and love is ending (Lily is leaving the apartment, leaving Marshall alone) the first thirty days are remarkably similar. (DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had s*x) For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed (Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to kill himself, miming a gun in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says ""It was a really beautiful song"". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants. (DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room)."
6956,23,2,1,Ted: Hey Marshall.
6957,23,2,1,Marshall: Hey Ted.
6958,23,2,1,Ted: Are you hungry?
6959,23,2,1,"Marshall: What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me."
6960,23,2,1,"Ted: At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!"
6961,23,2,1,"Marshall: Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped."
6962,23,2,1,"Ted: Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?"
6963,23,2,1,Marshall: Beer.
6964,23,2,1,"Ted: No, that's what you had for dinner."
6965,23,2,1,Marshall: Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover
6966,23,2,1,(He pulls a beer out of the couch)
6967,23,2,1,"DAY THIRTY-ONE, Ted, Robin and Barney are at MacLaren's."
6968,23,2,1,"Barney: So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed."
6969,23,2,1,Ted: You should write and illustrate children's books.
6970,23,2,1,"Barney: You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story."
6971,23,2,1,"Ted: It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess."
6972,23,2,1,"Robin: Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is."
6973,23,2,1,"Ted: Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's..."
6974,23,2,1,Robin: What?
6975,23,2,1,"Ted: God, your eyes are so blue."
6976,23,2,1,"Robin: Teddy bear... (They kiss, Barney mimes his death with a sword. Ted and Robin look at him and keep kissing)"
6977,23,2,1,"Ted from 2030: Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. (Ted and Robin are watching TV, Marshall comes out of the bathroom, a bottle of shampoo in his hand)."
6978,23,2,1,"Marshall: So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time."
6979,23,2,1,Robin: That's my shampoo.
6980,23,2,1,Marshall: Oh. Sorry.
6981,23,2,1,"Ted and Robin are in Ted's bedroom, making out."
6982,23,2,1,Robin: I thought he's never go to sleep.
6983,23,2,1,Ted: Uh-oh.
6984,23,2,1,Robin: Already?
6985,23,2,1,Ted: He's calling her. Dammit!
6986,23,2,1,Robin: I don't hear anyth...Ted (going out of the bedroom): He's calling her! (Tackling Marshall) Argh!
6987,23,2,1,"Marshall: Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her."
6988,23,2,1,"Marshall comes in the bathroom, Ted and Robin are taking a shower together."
6989,23,2,1,"Marshall: Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!"
6990,23,2,1,Robin (to Ted): Does he know I'm in here?
6991,23,2,1,"Marshall: Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins..."
6992,23,2,1,At MacLaren's.
6993,23,2,1,"Robin: This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night..."
6994,23,2,1,Barney: Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!
6995,23,2,1,Ted: They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.
6996,23,2,1,Robin: He slept on our floor last night Ted.
6997,23,2,1,Ted: He watched a scary movie.
6998,23,2,1,Robin: It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.
6999,23,2,1,Barney: Mmm. Sunshine.
7000,23,2,1,"DAY FORTY-ONE, in a strip club."
7001,23,2,1,"Man: Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!"
7002,23,2,1,"Marshall: Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help."
7003,23,2,1,"Barney: Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's."
7004,23,2,1,Marshall: There are a lot of them.
7005,23,2,1,"Barney: They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four."
7006,23,2,1,"DAY FORTY-FOUR, at a base-ball game."
7007,23,2,1,"Ted: Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!"
7008,23,2,1,"Marshall: I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside."
7009,23,2,1,"Man: Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise."
7010,23,2,1,"Ted: Oh, no. (A man is proposing to his girlfriend. Marshall stands up and throws a hotdog at the engaged couple.)"
7011,23,2,1,"Marshall: It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart! (Men drag Marshall out of the stadium) You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!"
7012,23,2,1,"DAY FORTY-SIX, at MacLaren's."
7013,23,2,1,"Ted: We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair."
7014,23,2,1,"Robin: See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak."
7015,23,2,1,"Barney: So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? (Ted and Barney laugh)"
7016,23,2,1,"At a shooting-range, Robin is shooting."
7017,23,2,1,"Robin: Yeah, that's the stuff."
7018,23,2,1,Marshall: Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?
7019,23,2,1,"Robin: My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun!"
7020,23,2,1,"Marshall: Um, you know, Ted is kinda against guns.Robin (turning to Marshall, her gun still in her hand): That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a gun, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try?"
7021,23,2,1,"Marshall: Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... (He shoots and falls down)"
7022,23,2,1,Robin: I should have mention the recoil.
7023,23,2,1,At MacLaren's.
7024,23,2,1,"Ted: I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that."
7025,23,2,1,"Robin: Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. (We see Marshall shooting and laughing maniacally )"
7026,23,2,1,"Ted: Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win."
7027,23,2,1,Robin: Oh! What do I win?
7028,23,2,1,Ted: I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.
7029,23,2,1,Robin: You are? That's so nice!
7030,23,2,1,"Ted: My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there."
7031,23,2,1,"Robin: Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?"
7032,23,2,1,"DAY FIFTY-FIVE, at the apartment."
7033,23,2,1,"Marshall: Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car."
7034,23,2,1,"Ted: Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?"
7035,23,2,1,Marshall: It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.
7036,23,2,1,Ted: So?
7037,23,2,1,Marshall: I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.
7038,23,2,1,"Ted: No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already."
7039,23,2,1,"Marshall: I know, but I just..."
7040,23,2,1,"DAY FIFTY SIX, at MacLaren's. Marshall is holding Lily's credit card bill which he stuck back together."
7041,23,2,1,"Marshall: August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?"
7042,23,2,1,"Marshall daydream, in San Francisco."
7043,23,2,1,"Lily: Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around."
7044,23,2,1,George Clinton: Only the best for my little Lily Pad.
7045,23,2,1,"Lily: Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style."
7046,23,2,1,George Clinton: I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
7047,23,2,1,"Lily: Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him."
7048,23,2,1,George Clinton: I got you a gift.
7049,23,2,1,"Lily: Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets."
7050,23,2,1,George Clinton: I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody.
7051,23,2,1,"Lily: It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton."
7052,23,2,1,"George Clinton: I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair."
7053,23,2,1,
7054,23,2,1,Back at MacLaren's.
7055,23,2,1,Ted: That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
7056,23,2,1,"Robin: Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable."
7057,23,2,1,"Marshall: Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats."
7058,23,2,1,Barney: Those charges are from a month ago.
7059,23,2,1,Ted: Exactly!
7060,23,2,1,"Barney: For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... (Marshall leaves the bar, running)."
7061,23,2,1,Ted: Why do you talk? Why do you talk?
7062,23,2,1,At the apartment.
7063,23,2,1,"Barney: He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password."
7064,23,2,1,"Marshall: There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer."
7065,23,2,1,Robin (to Ted): This has been holding in together?
7066,23,2,1,"Marshall: OK, you know what? I'm calling her."
7067,23,2,1,"Ted: No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. (To Barney) You, come here. (Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen). While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel."
7068,23,2,1,Barney: You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.
7069,23,2,1,Ted: Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. (To Robin) Come here my little baby. (Ted and Robin are making out)
7070,23,2,1,"Barney: OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple."
7071,23,2,1,Robin: Marshall!
7072,23,2,1,Ted: Marshall! Marshall!
7073,23,2,1,(Back in the living room)
7074,23,2,1,"Marshall: Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!"
7075,23,2,1,Ted: Everything we've worked so hard for...!
7076,23,2,1,"Marshall: Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you."
7077,23,2,1,Ted: Hang up now!
7078,23,2,1,"Marshall: Ted, I can't hang up now."
7079,23,2,1,Ted: Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!
7080,23,2,1,Marshall: Hello?! (He hangs up) A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.
7081,23,2,1,Barney: No!
7082,23,2,1,"Ted: Dude, you can't..."
7083,23,2,1,Marshall: I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.
7084,23,2,1,"Robin: Marshall, you can't do that!"
7085,23,2,1,Marshall: Really? Why not?
7086,23,2,1,Ted from 2030: 56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here.
7087,23,2,1,"Ted: Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?"
7088,23,2,1,Barney: Bold. Bold to go for the car.
7089,23,2,1,In the car.
7090,23,2,1,Ted: What?
7091,23,2,1,Robin: I didn't say a thing.
7092,23,2,1,Ted: You think I was too hard on him.
7093,23,2,1,Robin: I didn't say a thing.
7094,23,2,1,Ted: I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.
7095,23,2,1,"Robin: Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose."
7096,23,2,1,"Ted: Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?"
7097,23,2,1,"Robin: No, I'm a gun enthusiast."
7098,23,2,1,Ted: Do you know how many people are killed...
7099,23,2,1,Robin: The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...
7100,23,2,1,"Ted: Alright, alright. I was too hard on him."
7101,23,2,1,Robin: A little.
7102,23,2,1,"Ted: I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing."
7103,23,2,1,[Phone call]
7104,23,2,1,Barney: Barney.
7105,23,2,1,"Ted: Uh, hey. Where are you guys?"
7106,23,2,1,Barney: We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.
7107,23,2,1,Ted: Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?
7108,23,2,1,"Barney: Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh."
7109,23,2,1,Stripper: Already?
7110,23,2,1,Ted: What? What uh-oh?
7111,23,2,1,Barney: He's gone.
7112,23,2,1,Ted: You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.
7113,23,2,1,"Barney: Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!"
7114,23,2,1,Ted: Barney![End of the phone call]
7115,23,2,1,Robin: Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?
7116,23,2,1,Ted: A really nice one.
7117,23,2,1,At Lily's hotel.
7118,23,2,1,"Ted: Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!"
7119,23,2,1,Marshall: Hey.
7120,23,2,1,Ted: What happened?
7121,23,2,1,"Marshall: Well, I went up to Lily's floor..."
7122,23,2,1,[Flashback]
7123,23,2,1,"Marshall:...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. (A man is opening the door and Marshall is punching him in the face)."
7124,23,2,1,[End of flashback]
7125,23,2,1,Ted: You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?
7126,23,2,1,Marshall: Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
7127,23,2,1,Ted: What? Who was he?
7128,23,2,1,"Ted from 2030: His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer..."
7129,23,2,1,[Flashback]
7130,23,2,1,"Lily: Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?"
7131,23,2,1,"Waiter/Joey Adalian: Yes, I do.[End of flashback]"
7132,23,2,1,"Ted: So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?"
7133,23,2,1,Marshall: Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.
7134,23,2,1,"Ted: You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily."
7135,23,2,1,Marshall: Ted.
7136,23,2,1,Ted: Yeah.
7137,23,2,1,Marshall: I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.
7138,23,2,1,"Ted: What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers."
7139,23,2,1,"Marshall: OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers."
7140,23,2,1,Ted: Cheers.
7141,23,2,1,"DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: But it wasn't. 'cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning..."
7142,23,2,1,"DAY SIXTY-SEVEN, still at the apartment."
7143,23,2,1,Robin: Ted. Ted you should see this.
7144,23,2,1,"Ted: Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?"
7145,23,2,1,Marshall: It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.
7146,23,2,1,"Ted from 2030: It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time."
7147,24,2,2,"Ted from 2030: Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward."
7148,24,2,2,At MacLaren's.
7149,24,2,2,"Robin: Alright, see you guys later."
7150,24,2,2,Ted: I'll walk you out.
7151,24,2,2,Marshall: See ya.
7152,24,2,2,Barney: You just checked out Robin's ass.
7153,24,2,2,"Marshall: What? No. I... Barney, I was..."
7154,24,2,2,"Barney: Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead."
7155,24,2,2,Marshall: Lily.
7156,24,2,2,"Barney: Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass."
7157,24,2,2,Marshall: I did not Ted...
7158,24,2,2,Ted: Awesome! You're finally getting better.
7159,24,2,2,"Barney: This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in."
7160,24,2,2,Ted: Yes!
7161,24,2,2,"Marshall: Oh, God!"
7162,24,2,2,"Barney: Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?"
7163,24,2,2,Marshall: Candy.
7164,24,2,2,Barney: Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?
7165,24,2,2,Ted: Mounds.
7166,24,2,2,Barney: Milk Duds.
7167,24,2,2,Ted: Gobstoppers.
7168,24,2,2,Barney: Um...
7169,24,2,2,Ted from 2030: This went on for another hour. I'll just skip to the end.
7170,24,2,2,Ted: Dubble Bubbles.
7171,24,2,2,"Barney: Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer."
7172,24,2,2,Marshall: Fine.
7173,24,2,2,Ted (on the phone): Hey Robin. Marshall checked out your ass.
7174,24,2,2,"Marshall: Ted, what is wrong with you?"
7175,24,2,2,"Robin (on the phone): He checked out my ass? Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day. Cool. See ya."
7176,24,2,2,Robin reaches her apartment. Lily is on her landing.
7177,24,2,2,Robin: Lily.
7178,24,2,2,Lily: It is a great ass.
7179,24,2,2,CREDIT TITLES
7180,24,2,2,"Ted from 2030: None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say."
7181,24,2,2,Robin: Your hair is adorable!
7182,24,2,2,Lily: Thank you! (They hug)
7183,24,2,2,"At MacLaren's.Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17."
7184,24,2,2,Barney: Hi. Have you met Marshall?
7185,24,2,2,Woman: Hi.
7186,24,2,2,"Marshall: Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you."
7187,24,2,2,"Barney: I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?"
7188,24,2,2,"Woman: Umm... I guess. (Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand). Oh my God! (Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand) Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!"
7189,24,2,2,In a snack bar.
7190,24,2,2,"Barney: Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl."
7191,24,2,2,Marshall: You went home with her!
7192,24,2,2,"Barney: Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar..."
7193,24,2,2,"Marshall: Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again."
7194,24,2,2,Barney: Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!
7195,24,2,2,"Marshall: Oh, really?"
7196,24,2,2,"Barney: My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night."
7197,24,2,2,"Marshall: Oh, come on. Does that really work?"
7198,24,2,2,Barney: Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.
7199,24,2,2,"Marshall: Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in."
7200,24,2,2,"At the apartment, Robin arrives."
7201,24,2,2,Robin: You've gotta hear this.
7202,24,2,2,Ted: You will not believe what just happened.
7203,24,2,2,Robin: You go first.
7204,24,2,2,Ted: I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...
7205,24,2,2,Robin: Lily is back in town.
7206,24,2,2,Ted: And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?
7207,24,2,2,"Robin: Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today."
7208,24,2,2,Ted: How is she doing?
7209,24,2,2,Robin: You're not gonna like it.
7210,24,2,2,[FLASHBACK]
7211,24,2,2,"Lily: I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now."
7212,24,2,2,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7213,24,2,2,Ted: She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.
7214,24,2,2,[FLASHBACK]
7215,24,2,2,"Lily: Oh, the art program, best thing ever."
7216,24,2,2,"In San Francisco, Lily is painting."
7217,24,2,2,"Man: Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. (The man is giving Lily his paintbrush)."
7218,24,2,2,"In New-York, with Robin."
7219,24,2,2,"Lily: But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry."
7220,24,2,2,"In San Francisco, in a bus.Man 1: Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel."
7221,24,2,2,Woman: I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!
7222,24,2,2,"Man 2: I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way."
7223,24,2,2,In New-York.
7224,24,2,2,"Robin: Wow, I am so happy for you."
7225,24,2,2,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7226,24,2,2,"Ted: Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret."
7227,24,2,2,Robin: You never chose sides. I respect that.
7228,24,2,2,Ted: She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!
7229,24,2,2,(Marshall arrives.)
7230,24,2,2,Marshall: Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?
7231,24,2,2,"Ted: Uh, listen Marshall..."
7232,24,2,2,Robin: Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.
7233,24,2,2,Marshall: Way to go.
7234,24,2,2,(Marshall goes into his bedroom.)
7235,24,2,2,"Ted: OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him."
7236,24,2,2,"Robin: No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?"
7237,24,2,2,Ted: She's moved on?
7238,24,2,2,"Robin: Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?"
7239,24,2,2,At MacLaren's.
7240,24,2,2,Barney: Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.
7241,24,2,2,Marshall: Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.
7242,24,2,2,Barney: Excellent. Have you chosen your entrée?
7243,24,2,2,"Marshall: I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar."
7244,24,2,2,"Barney: Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it."
7245,24,2,2,"Marshall (to the girl): Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall."
7246,24,2,2,"Girl: Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on."
7247,24,2,2,Barney: Nice recovery. I think it's working.
7248,24,2,2,"Marshall: Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy."
7249,24,2,2,"Amy: Hey Barney, nice to meet you."
7250,24,2,2,"Barney: Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?"
7251,24,2,2,At the apartment.
7252,24,2,2,Marshall: I hate you.
7253,24,2,2,Barney: I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here.
7254,24,2,2,Marshall: Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!
7255,24,2,2,Barney: I know but tonight...
7256,24,2,2,"Marshall: No, forget it. You're such a jackass!"
7257,24,2,2,"Barney (with you're a jerk writing on his hand): I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion & The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter."
7258,24,2,2,"Marshall: OK, but no magic. (He turns to Barney who disappeared). How did you do that?"
7259,24,2,2,"Barney: I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass."
7260,24,2,2,In a building.Ted from 2030: Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily.
7261,24,2,2,"Lily: But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing."
7262,24,2,2,Ted: Yeah.
7263,24,2,2,Lily: It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.
7264,24,2,2,(She leaves.)
7265,24,2,2,Robin: What?
7266,24,2,2,"Ted: She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!"
7267,24,2,2,"Robin: No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy."
7268,24,2,2,Ted: Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.
7269,24,2,2,"Robin: Trust me, I'm a girl!"
7270,24,2,2,Ted: Yeah. But you're Canadian.
7271,24,2,2,Robin: Why do you always have to bring that up?
7272,24,2,2,Ted: You're our weird neighbors!
7273,24,2,2,Robin: You bring it up every time...
7274,24,2,2,"Ted: No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall."
7275,24,2,2,Robin: You're on.
7276,24,2,2,Ted: Five American bucks.
7277,24,2,2,"Robin: Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?"
7278,24,2,2,"Ted: Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything."
7279,24,2,2,"(Lily come back.)Lily: I hope this is my new home. (She comes in the apartment) Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment."
7280,24,2,2,"At the apartment, Barney knocks at the door, Marshall opens."
7281,24,2,2,"Barney: Marshall Eriksen, suit up!"
7282,24,2,2,Marshall: No way.
7283,24,2,2,Barney: Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.
7284,24,2,2,Marshall: Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.
7285,24,2,2,Barney: Come on...
7286,24,2,2,Marshall: Sleeves.
7287,24,2,2,Barney: There is nothing in my sl...
7288,24,2,2,Marshall: Oh is that right?
7289,24,2,2,Barney: Huh? Huh? Let's go.
7290,24,2,2,Marshall: Behind my ear.
7291,24,2,2,Barney: Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!
7292,24,2,2,Marshall: Ohh!
7293,24,2,2,
7294,24,2,2,At The Scorpion & the Toad bar.
7295,24,2,2,"Girl: Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me though."
7296,24,2,2,"Marshall: Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah."
7297,24,2,2,"In an other spot of the Scorpion & the Toad.Barney (to a girl): You must be majoring in chemistry 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh... (The girl leaves / to the girl's friend) College lesbian phase."
7298,24,2,2,Back to Marshall and the first girl.
7299,24,2,2,"Girl: Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again."
7300,24,2,2,"Marshall: Yes, it would. It really would."
7301,24,2,2,Girl: Maybe I'll see you here sometimes.
7302,24,2,2,"Marshall: Probably not. I'm never here, so..."
7303,24,2,2,"Girl: You know, I do have a phone number."
7304,24,2,2,Marshall: Great. Nice.
7305,24,2,2,"Barney: Hi, I'm Barney."
7306,24,2,2,"Marshall: Oh, no."
7307,24,2,2,Barney: Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?
7308,24,2,2,Girl: Sure.
7309,24,2,2,In a cab.
7310,24,2,2,"Marshall: Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?"
7311,24,2,2,"Barney: Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too."
7312,24,2,2,Marshall (choking Barney): I'll kill you!
7313,24,2,2,At Robin's apartment.
7314,24,2,2,"Lily: And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?"
7315,24,2,2,"In the cab, Marshall still chokes Barney."
7316,24,2,2,Marshall: Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...
7317,24,2,2,Barney: I'm not giving you...
7318,24,2,2,Back at Robin's.
7319,24,2,2,Ted: Terrific.
7320,24,2,2,"Lily: That is so good to hear. (Lily's phone rings). Oh, hold on. This could be about he apartment. (She leaves the room)."
7321,24,2,2,"Ted: OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy."
7322,24,2,2,(Lily come back.)
7323,24,2,2,Lily: I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. (She starts crying).
7324,24,2,2,"Ted: Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?"
7325,24,2,2,"Robin: No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him."
7326,24,2,2,Lily: The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! (Robin gives back Ted his five dollars)
7327,24,2,2,In the cab.
7328,24,2,2,Barney: Stop it!
7329,24,2,2,Marshall: You don't want to see me when I'm angry!
7330,24,2,2,"Barney: Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. (He sends the card across the window)."
7331,24,2,2,Marshall: Stop the cab! (Marshall gets out of the car)
7332,24,2,2,"Barney: No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. (He pulls the card out of his sleeve). Oh, she does have a cute handwriting."
7333,24,2,2,In a snack-bar.Ted from 2030: About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy.
7334,24,2,2,"Waiter: Morning guys, what can I get you?"
7335,24,2,2,"Lily: Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake."
7336,24,2,2,"Waiter: For you, sir?"
7337,24,2,2,Ted: Gravy.
7338,24,2,2,Waiter: You want that gravy on something?
7339,24,2,2,Ted: Surprise me.
7340,24,2,2,Robin: I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.
7341,24,2,2,Lily: What are you charpy about?
7342,24,2,2,Ted: She's still drunk from last night.
7343,24,2,2,Robin: I don't think so! Whoo!
7344,24,2,2,"Ted: Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?"
7345,24,2,2,Lily: I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...
7346,24,2,2,"[FLASHBACK, Robin and Lily visit an apartment]"
7347,24,2,2,"Robin: But it's good, I mean work's great..."
7348,24,2,2,"Lily: Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? (They are now with Ted in an other building) Shut up and talk about Marshall. Shut up and talk about Marshall! Shut up and talk about Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Aaah I gotta ask! (Then, the three of them are in Robin's apartment) And, hey, how is Marshall?"
7349,24,2,2,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7350,24,2,2,Lily: It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.
7351,24,2,2,Ted: But I thought your summer was great?!
7352,24,2,2,Lily: Not exactly...
7353,24,2,2,"[FLASHBACK, in San Francisco, Lily paints]"
7354,24,2,2,Man: Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything.
7355,24,2,2,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7356,24,2,2,Ted: So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?
7357,24,2,2,"Lily: Yeah, um..."
7358,24,2,2,"[FLASHBACK, in a bus]"
7359,24,2,2,Man: I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.
7360,24,2,2,"I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way."
7361,24,2,2,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7362,24,2,2,"Lily: I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?"
7363,24,2,2,"Ted: In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms."
7364,24,2,2,"Lily: Wow. So, maybe I should call him?"
7365,24,2,2,"Ted: Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word ""maybe"". ""Maybe"" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him."
7366,24,2,2,Robin (laughing): This guy like pennies!
7367,24,2,2,At MacLaren's.
7368,24,2,2,Barney: Hi Marshall.
7369,24,2,2,"Marshall: No, go away, I don't want to talk to you."
7370,24,2,2,"Barney: OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had s*x with you."
7371,24,2,2,"Marshall: There is no ""would"" in s*x. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it."
7372,24,2,2,"Barney: You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't."
7373,24,2,2,Marshall: That's not possible.
7374,24,2,2,"Barney: Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!"
7375,24,2,2,Marshall: A twin isn't the same person.
7376,24,2,2,"Barney: Of course, it is. What do you think ""identical"" means? ""Ident-"" - same. ""-ical"" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date."
7377,24,2,2,Marshall: Fine.
7378,24,2,2,Barney: Ah!
7379,24,2,2,"Marshall: But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin."
7380,24,2,2,Barney: Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.
7381,24,2,2,Ted from 2030: So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.
7382,24,2,2,Barney: How are you doing?
7383,24,2,2,Marshall: Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.
7384,24,2,2,"Barney: You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening."
7385,24,2,2,Marshall: It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.
7386,24,2,2,Barney: But they're twins.
7387,24,2,2,Marshall: You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.
7388,24,2,2,"Barney: Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend..."
7389,24,2,2,Marshall: Ted's my best friend.
7390,24,2,2,"Barney:...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. (Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar). Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning."
7391,24,2,2,Twin 1: What?
7392,24,2,2,Twin 2: That's so bad. I really liked him.
7393,24,2,2,Barney: Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.
7394,24,2,2,"Outside of MacLaren's, Marshall runs into Lily."
7395,24,2,2,Marshall: Lily. What are you doing here?
7396,24,2,2,"Lily: Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello."
7397,24,2,2,"Marshall: Lily, this was the worst summer of my life."
7398,24,2,2,Lily: I know. It was the worst summer of my life.
7399,24,2,2,Marshall: It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.
7400,24,2,2,Lily: Can we please get back together?
7401,24,2,2,"Marshall: All that crap you said to me about ""we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own."". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart."
7402,24,2,2,Lily: Can we please get back together?
7403,24,2,2,"Marshall: Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now."
7404,24,2,2,Lily: Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?
7405,24,2,2,Marshall: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.
7406,24,2,2,"Lily: Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. (Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later). And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York."
7407,24,2,2,Marshall: Yeah.
7408,24,2,2,"Lily: Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you."
7409,24,2,2,"Marshall: Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why."
7410,24,2,2,"In MacLaren's, Barney is still with the twins."
7411,24,2,2,"Barney: So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? (Lily arrives.) Lily?"
7412,24,2,2,"Lily: You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! (She throws a drink at his face and leaves)"
7413,24,2,2,"Barney: So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!"
7414,24,2,2,(Lily shows up again)
7415,24,2,2,"Lily: You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! (She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins)."
7416,25,2,3,Year 2030
7417,25,2,3,"Ted: Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong."
7418,25,2,3,Year 2006
7419,25,2,3,Lily: I wish your face would melt off.
7420,25,2,3,Marshall: I wish your eyeballs would explode.
7421,25,2,3,Lily: I hate you.
7422,25,2,3,Marshall: I hate you more.
7423,25,2,3,Ted: I'm going to kill him.
7424,25,2,3,Barney: I can't say I blame you.
7425,25,2,3,"Ted: No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him."
7426,25,2,3,Robin: I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.
7427,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Not now.
7428,25,2,3,"Robin: Okay, if you don't, I will."
7429,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)
7430,25,2,3,"Ted from 2030: Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part."
7431,25,2,3,The Marshall and Lily part.
7432,25,2,3,"The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend."
7433,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited."
7434,25,2,3,Ted: You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?
7435,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Coffee?
7436,25,2,3,"Ted from 2030: You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real."
7437,25,2,3,"Lily: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby."
7438,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall."
7439,25,2,3,Marshall: Good to see you.
7440,25,2,3,Lily: I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.
7441,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well..."
7442,25,2,3,Marshall: Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?
7443,25,2,3,Lily: Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?
7444,25,2,3,Ted's mother: I love your hair.
7445,25,2,3,OPENING
7446,25,2,3,"Ted from 2030: This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward."
7447,25,2,3,"Marshall: Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good."
7448,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00. Lily, would you like to join us?"
7449,25,2,3,Lily (looking at Marshall): Um...
7450,25,2,3,Marshall: What?
7451,25,2,3,"Lily: Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable."
7452,25,2,3,Marshall: Why would it?
7453,25,2,3,"Lily: Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us."
7454,25,2,3,"Marshall: Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister."
7455,25,2,3,"Lily: ""Brother and sister""?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. (She leaves)"
7456,25,2,3,Ted from 2030: See? Not awkward at all.
7457,25,2,3,"The evening, at ""Casa a Pezzi"". Lily arrives."
7458,25,2,3,"Lily: Hello, everyone."
7459,25,2,3,All: Hi.
7460,25,2,3,"Lily: Hello, Marshall."
7461,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Lily, that is a stunning dress."
7462,25,2,3,"Lily: Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, ""Hey, we're all family."" Right, bro? Ooh, ah..."
7463,25,2,3,Ted: What's wrong?
7464,25,2,3,"Lily: Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... (She breathes deeply while Marshall glances at her low neckline) Are you all right? You're kind of sweating."
7465,25,2,3,"Marshall: No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy."
7466,25,2,3,"The next morning, at the apartment."
7467,25,2,3,"Marshall: Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too."
7468,25,2,3,"Barney: Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch."
7469,25,2,3,"Marshall: No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves."
7470,25,2,3,Barney: That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.
7471,25,2,3,"Marshall: Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs."
7472,25,2,3,Barney: I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.
7473,25,2,3,At brunch.
7474,25,2,3,Ted from 2030: So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.
7475,25,2,3,Marshall: Hello.
7476,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, hi."
7477,25,2,3,"Ted: Hey, Marshall."
7478,25,2,3,Robin: Hey.
7479,25,2,3,Lily: Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.
7480,25,2,3,"Marshall: Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?"
7481,25,2,3,"Lily: Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips) What are you doing?"
7482,25,2,3,"Marshall: Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. (He starts massaging his calve) Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up."
7483,25,2,3,Marshall and Lily are in the restaurant bathroom.
7484,25,2,3,Marshall: Take off your dress.
7485,25,2,3,Lily: Take off the rest of your pants.
7486,25,2,3,"Later, leaving the bathroom and joining the table."
7487,25,2,3,Lily: I really wasn't expecting that to happen.
7488,25,2,3,"Marshall: Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?"
7489,25,2,3,"Lily: Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg."
7490,25,2,3,"Marshall: Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs."
7491,25,2,3,"Lily: Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me."
7492,25,2,3,Marshall: Seduce you? You seduced me.
7493,25,2,3,Lily: You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.
7494,25,2,3,Marshall: You went to San Francisco for three months.
7495,25,2,3,Lily: How is that seducing you?
7496,25,2,3,"Marshall: Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it."
7497,25,2,3,"Lily: All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology."
7498,25,2,3,"Marshall: Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews."
7499,25,2,3,Lily: You are evil.
7500,25,2,3,The waitress (taking a photo): Smile!
7501,25,2,3,Ted: I'm going to kill him.
7502,25,2,3,Barney: I can't say I blame you.
7503,25,2,3,"Ted: No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him."
7504,25,2,3,Ted from 2030: Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.
7505,25,2,3,The Barney part.
7506,25,2,3,"The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous."
7507,25,2,3,(Somebody knocks at the door. Ted opens. It's Barney.)
7508,25,2,3,"Ted: Barney, what are you doing here?"
7509,25,2,3,Barney: Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.
7510,25,2,3,Ted: I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.
7511,25,2,3,Barney: What?
7512,25,2,3,"Ted: Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball."
7513,25,2,3,Barney: But I'm your best friend.
7514,25,2,3,"Ted: Well, actually Marshall's my..."
7515,25,2,3,Barney: I'm the most important person in your life.
7516,25,2,3,"Ted: Well, Robin's actually..."
7517,25,2,3,Barney: How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.
7518,25,2,3,"Robin: To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have."
7519,25,2,3,"Barney: Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today."
7520,25,2,3,"(Knock at the door, Ted opens.)"
7521,25,2,3,"Ted: Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad."
7522,25,2,3,Ted's father: Ted.
7523,25,2,3,Ted: I know you've all been excited to meet...
7524,25,2,3,"Barney: Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint ""Bless This Mess"" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? (Ted's parents and Barney laugh)"
7525,25,2,3,"Ted: Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin."
7526,25,2,3,Ted's father: Hello.
7527,25,2,3,Robin: Hello.
7528,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al?"
7529,25,2,3,Ted's father: A real looker.
7530,25,2,3,"Robin: That's funny, I didn't even ""look"" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00."
7531,25,2,3,"Barney (laughing): San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had."
7532,25,2,3,Ted's mother: I love salmon risotto.
7533,25,2,3,Barney: I know.
7534,25,2,3,Robin: How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.
7535,25,2,3,"Barney: Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because..."
7536,25,2,3,"Ted: Stop it! Don't, don't!"
7537,25,2,3,"Barney: Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?"
7538,25,2,3,In the kitchen.
7539,25,2,3,"Robin: What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass."
7540,25,2,3,"Barney: Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!"
7541,25,2,3,(Ted's mother comes in the kitchen)
7542,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Can I help?
7543,25,2,3,"Barney: Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it."
7544,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Well, funny you should ask..."
7545,25,2,3,"At ""Casa a pezzi"". Barney is playing the piano.Ted's father: Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!"
7546,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful."
7547,25,2,3,"Barney: No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening."
7548,25,2,3,"Lily: Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold."
7549,25,2,3,"Marshall: All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute."
7550,25,2,3,Barney: Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?
7551,25,2,3,"Robin: No, I'm kind of tired."
7552,25,2,3,"Lily: Me, too."
7553,25,2,3,"Ted: Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want..."
7554,25,2,3,Ted's father: I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.
7555,25,2,3,Ted: Cervezas? Did he fall?
7556,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow."
7557,25,2,3,"Barney: St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service."
7558,25,2,3,Ted: Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?
7559,25,2,3,Barney: I'll save you a seat.
7560,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?"
7561,25,2,3,Robin: Robin.
7562,25,2,3,"Barney: Susan, her name is Virginia."
7563,25,2,3,"The next morning, at the aprtment."
7564,25,2,3,"Barney: Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now."
7565,25,2,3,Ted: Why?
7566,25,2,3,"Barney: Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?"
7567,25,2,3,"[FALSHBACK, at MacLaren's]"
7568,25,2,3,"Ted's father (talking to a girl): So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety."
7569,25,2,3,Girl: Wow. You're like a hero.
7570,25,2,3,"Barney: Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry."
7571,25,2,3,"Girl: You poor, brave man."
7572,25,2,3,Ted's father: Why don't you give the guy a hug?
7573,25,2,3,Barney: I'm... oh. (They hug).
7574,25,2,3,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7575,25,2,3,"Ted: My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?"
7576,25,2,3,"Barney: I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom."
7577,25,2,3,Ted: Sure.
7578,25,2,3,"Barney: Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back..."
7579,25,2,3,"(Flashback: Barney arrives in the bar, sees Ted's father making out with Wendy and takes a photo of them with his phone. Back at the apartment, he hands Ted the phone)"
7580,25,2,3,"Ted: Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!"
7581,25,2,3,Barney: I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?
7582,25,2,3,"Ted: My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible."
7583,25,2,3,"Barney: Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side."
7584,25,2,3,"Ted: Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use ""83%""?"
7585,25,2,3,"Barney: You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at  m http://www.swingers.open-marriage-is-na ... lygamy.org m  have, and they beg to differ."
7586,25,2,3,Ted: That's not a real Web site.
7587,25,2,3,"Barney: Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K."
7588,25,2,3,"(Knock at the door, Ted opens)"
7589,25,2,3,"Ted: Hi, Dad."
7590,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Hey, Ted. Barney!"
7591,25,2,3,Ted: Enjoying your vacation so far?
7592,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, yeah."
7593,25,2,3,"Ted: Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?"
7594,25,2,3,Ted's father: Sure.
7595,25,2,3,
7596,25,2,3,Outside.
7597,25,2,3,Ted: So you went out with Barney last night?
7598,25,2,3,Ted's father: Yeah.
7599,25,2,3,Ted: You have a good time?
7600,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us."
7601,25,2,3,Ted: Yeah. So...
7602,25,2,3,Ted's father: What?
7603,25,2,3,Ted: Well...
7604,25,2,3,Ted's father: Well what?
7605,25,2,3,Ted: You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title?
7606,25,2,3,At brunch.
7607,25,2,3,"Ted: I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene"
7608,25,2,3,"Barney: Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure."
7609,25,2,3,The waitress (taking a photo): Smile!
7610,25,2,3,Robin: I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.
7611,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Not now.
7612,25,2,3,"Robin: Okay, if you don't, I will."
7613,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)
7614,25,2,3,"Ted from 2030: Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story."
7615,25,2,3,The me and Robin part.
7616,25,2,3,"The previous day, at the apartment."
7617,25,2,3,Ted from 2030: We were expecting my parents at any minute.
7618,25,2,3,Ted: One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.
7619,25,2,3,Robin: But this is the first time she's meeting me.
7620,25,2,3,Ted: Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.
7621,25,2,3,Robin: But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?
7622,25,2,3,Ted: You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.
7623,25,2,3,Robin: I'm gonna lie.
7624,25,2,3,Ted: I would.
7625,25,2,3,"At ""Casa a pezzi""."
7626,25,2,3,Lily: Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.
7627,25,2,3,Marshall: I know how important it is to you.
7628,25,2,3,Ted's mother: I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again.
7629,25,2,3,"Ted: Oh, good for her."
7630,25,2,3,"Ted's mother (to Robin): So, dear..."
7631,25,2,3,"Robin: Oh, boy."
7632,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Tell us what it's like being a journalist.
7633,25,2,3,Robin: I'm just not ready.
7634,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Okay. No pressure.
7635,25,2,3,"Robin: Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great."
7636,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later."
7637,25,2,3,"Barney: Ooh, a piano!"
7638,25,2,3,"The next morning, at the apartment."
7639,25,2,3,"Ted: You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?"
7640,25,2,3,"Robin: Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with."
7641,25,2,3,Ted: Hooray?
7642,25,2,3,"Robin: I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman."
7643,25,2,3,"Ted: Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important."
7644,25,2,3,At brunch.
7645,25,2,3,Barney: What happened to Marshall and Lily?
7646,25,2,3,Ted: They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.
7647,25,2,3,Waitress: More coffee?
7648,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet?"
7649,25,2,3,"Robin: Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies."
7650,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Excuse me?
7651,25,2,3,"Robin: Nothing. (She leaves the table to go to the bathroom, the door is locked, she knocks.)"
7652,25,2,3,Lily: Just a minute.
7653,25,2,3,Marshall: Maybe less.
7654,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you?"
7655,25,2,3,Robin: Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?
7656,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Do you want to have my grandkids?
7657,25,2,3,"Robin: No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and..."
7658,25,2,3,(Marshall and Lily go out the bathroom)
7659,25,2,3,Marshall: Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.
7660,25,2,3,"Lily: Marshall, your zipper."
7661,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young."
7662,25,2,3,"Robin: Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?"
7663,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Well... Okay, there's something you don't know..."
7664,25,2,3,Back to the table.
7665,25,2,3,Waitress: Smile!
7666,25,2,3,Lily: I wish your face would melt off.
7667,25,2,3,Marshall: I wish your eyeballs would explode.
7668,25,2,3,Ted: I'm gonna kill him.
7669,25,2,3,"Robin: I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him."
7670,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Not now.
7671,25,2,3,"Robin: Okay, if you don't, I will."
7672,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)
7673,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart."
7674,25,2,3,"Ted: Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! (To the waitress) I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad."
7675,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Ted, what are you talking about?"
7676,25,2,3,"Ted: Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?"
7677,25,2,3,Ted's father: Okay. I hooked up with a waitress.
7678,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Oh.
7679,25,2,3,Ted: Oh?
7680,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh!"
7681,25,2,3,"Ted: Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?"
7682,25,2,3,Robin: Mrs. Mosby?
7683,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this..."
7684,25,2,3,Ted's father: Your mother and I are divorced.
7685,25,2,3,Ted: What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?
7686,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now."
7687,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Closer to ten, I think."
7688,25,2,3,Ted's mother: Time flies.
7689,25,2,3,"Ted: So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?"
7690,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: No, it wasn't a snap decision."
7691,25,2,3,Ted's father: We'd been separated almost two years.
7692,25,2,3,Ted: How could you not tell me this?!
7693,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time."
7694,25,2,3,Ted: So last Christmas...?
7695,25,2,3,"Ted's father: We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy."
7696,25,2,3,Ted: I got you a tandem bike.
7697,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time."
7698,25,2,3,Ted: Who the hell is Frank?!
7699,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces."
7700,25,2,3,"Ted: Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. (He leaves, following by his parents and Robin)"
7701,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Teddy bear, oh..."
7702,25,2,3,"Barney: You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station."
7703,25,2,3,Marshall: Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.
7704,25,2,3,"Lily: Me, too."
7705,25,2,3,Marshall: I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.
7706,25,2,3,Lily: It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.
7707,25,2,3,"Marshall: Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?"
7708,25,2,3,Lily: Did you Mystic Tan your calves?
7709,25,2,3,Marshall: I withdraw the question.
7710,25,2,3,Outside.Ted's father: We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.
7711,25,2,3,Ted's mother: It was wrong not to tell you.
7712,25,2,3,Ted: Thank you.
7713,25,2,3,"Ted's father: But listen, don't tell your sister."
7714,25,2,3,Ted's mother: It would just upset her.
7715,25,2,3,"Ted: No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball."
7716,25,2,3,Ted's father: Indians won today on a walk-off double.
7717,25,2,3,"Ted: Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met."
7718,25,2,3,Ted's father: I never told you how I met your mother?
7719,25,2,3,Ted: No.
7720,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Oh, great story. At a bar."
7721,25,2,3,"Ted: That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story."
7722,25,2,3,Ted's father: I think it was an Irish bar.
7723,25,2,3,"Ted: I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?"
7724,25,2,3,Ted's father: We just realized we're very different people.
7725,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth."
7726,25,2,3,Ted: So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.
7727,25,2,3,Ted's father: I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids.
7728,25,2,3,Ted: Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.
7729,25,2,3,"Ted's mother: On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in."
7730,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together."
7731,25,2,3,Ted's mother: But we love Robin.
7732,25,2,3,"Ted's father: Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight."
7733,25,2,3,Ted's mother: We'll see you inside.
7734,25,2,3,Ted's father: Sorry.
7735,25,2,3,Robin: Wow.
7736,25,2,3,Ted: I know.
7737,25,2,3,Robin: They love me!
7738,25,2,3,"Back inside, later.Ted's mother: So we are definitely going to try and communicate more."
7739,25,2,3,"Ted's father: From now on, full disclosure."
7740,25,2,3,"Ted: Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls."
7741,25,2,3,Ted's mother: I'm gonna get some juice.
7742,25,2,3,Ted: No. No.
7743,26,2,4,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes your relationship goes so smoothly for so long that you think it will be that way forever. It never is."
7744,26,2,4,"At MacLaren's, Ted arrives."
7745,26,2,4,"Ted: Well, we just had our first fight."
7746,26,2,4,Robin joins Lily at a chiroposdist's place.
7747,26,2,4,Robin: We had our first fight.
7748,26,2,4,MacLaren's.
7749,26,2,4,"Barney: Oh, no, what'd you fight about? (He puts his headphones on)."
7750,26,2,4,"Ted: A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building..."
7751,26,2,4,Chiroposdist's place.
7752,26,2,4,Robin: It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.
7753,26,2,4,MacLaren's.
7754,26,2,4,"Ted: And if we don't get it, we could go under."
7755,26,2,4,Chiropodist's place.
7756,26,2,4,"Robin: So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company."
7757,26,2,4,"(At Ted's office, the head architect unveils his new design, everybody applauses except for Ted.)"
7758,26,2,4,MacLaren's.
7759,26,2,4,Both Marshall and Barney: No.
7760,26,2,4,Ted: Yes.
7761,26,2,4,"Marshall: Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a..."
7762,26,2,4,"Ted: Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front."
7763,26,2,4,"Marshall: Wow, so it's the whole package."
7764,26,2,4,"Barney: Yeah, you did."
7765,26,2,4,Marshall: Had to.
7766,26,2,4,"Barney: Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft."
7767,26,2,4,"Marshall: Yeah, you did."
7768,26,2,4,Barney: Had to.
7769,26,2,4,"Ted: It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices."
7770,26,2,4,"Marshall: Yeah, you did."
7771,26,2,4,Ted: That wasn't one.
7772,26,2,4,CREDIT TITLES
7773,26,2,4,At the chiroposdist's.
7774,26,2,4,"Lily: So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me."
7775,26,2,4,"Robin: Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm."
7776,26,2,4,"Lily: Ooh, two tragedies in one day."
7777,26,2,4,"Robin: The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done."
7778,26,2,4,"[FLASHBACK, at the apartment]"
7779,26,2,4,Ted: Hey.
7780,26,2,4,Robin: Hey.
7781,26,2,4,Ted: How was your day?
7782,26,2,4,Robin: Good.
7783,26,2,4,"Ted: Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?"
7784,26,2,4,"Robin: No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?"
7785,26,2,4,"Ted: You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time."
7786,26,2,4,"Robin: Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter."
7787,26,2,4,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7788,26,2,4,Lily: Robin!
7789,26,2,4,Robin: What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.
7790,26,2,4,Lily: You should work at a suicide hotline.
7791,26,2,4,Robin: And then it got ugly.
7792,26,2,4,[FLASHBACK]
7793,26,2,4,"Robin: What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough."
7794,26,2,4,"(At MacLaren's, Marshall and Barney make a face.)"
7795,26,2,4,Ted: So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams?
7796,26,2,4,Robin: It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.
7797,26,2,4,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7798,26,2,4,"Robin: So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie."
7799,26,2,4,"Lily: Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie."
7800,26,2,4,At MacLaren's.
7801,26,2,4,Ted: How do you not like Field of Dreams?!
7802,26,2,4,At the chiropodist's.
7803,26,2,4,"Lily: Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI."
7804,26,2,4,Robin: I guess I don't know how to do that.
7805,26,2,4,"Lily: Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop."
7806,26,2,4,"Robin: No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?"
7807,26,2,4,"Lily: What the hell comes before ""Q""?"
7808,26,2,4,At MacLaren's.
7809,26,2,4,"Ted: Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter."
7810,26,2,4,Barney (brokenly): Can we talk about something else?
7811,26,2,4,"Marshall: You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up."
7812,26,2,4,"Barney: Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?"
7813,26,2,4,"Marshall: That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck."
7814,26,2,4,"Barney: Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing."
7815,26,2,4,"Ted: I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job."
7816,26,2,4,Marshall: Your job's not boring.
7817,26,2,4,Ted: Robin thinks so.
7818,26,2,4,"Barney: Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God."
7819,26,2,4,Ted: I love it when you quote Scripture.
7820,26,2,4,"Barney: I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies."
7821,26,2,4,"Ted: Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever."
7822,26,2,4,"Barney: That's 'cause you're always like... (Dully) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". If it were me, I'd be like... (Confidently) ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude."
7823,26,2,4,"Marshall (suavely): Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off.."
7824,26,2,4,"Barney: Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. ""Ted Mosby, architect"". Trust me."
7825,26,2,4,(Barney and marshall leave. Ted starts leaving and suddenly walk to a girl)
7826,26,2,4,"Ted: Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?"
7827,26,2,4,Girl: Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?
7828,26,2,4,Ted: Solid point. She did have hair of gold.
7829,26,2,4,"Girl: Yes, she did."
7830,26,2,4,Ted: Mm-hmm.
7831,26,2,4,"Later, Robin and Lily arrive at MacLaren's."
7832,26,2,4,"Robin: Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?"
7833,26,2,4,"Carl: No. Hey, Lily. You still single?"
7834,26,2,4,Lily: Yes.
7835,26,2,4,Carl: You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.
7836,26,2,4,"Lily: Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade s*x for beer?"
7837,26,2,4,Carl: Only if you're into it. It's on me.
7838,26,2,4,Lily: Thanks.
7839,26,2,4,Robin: I wonder where Ted went.
7840,26,2,4,"A girl: Ted Mosby, the architect?"
7841,26,2,4,"Robin: Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier."
7842,26,2,4,"[FLASHBACK. The girl, the one whose Ted was talking to earlier and Ted]"
7843,26,2,4,Girl 1: And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect?
7844,26,2,4,"Ted: Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess."
7845,26,2,4,"Girl 1: I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me."
7846,26,2,4,"Ted: Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?"
7847,26,2,4,Girls: Yeah.
7848,26,2,4,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7849,26,2,4,"Lily: He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?"
7850,26,2,4,"Robin: Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part."
7851,26,2,4,"Lily: What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out."
7852,26,2,4,"Robin: I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat."
7853,26,2,4,Girl: She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.
7854,26,2,4,"Robin: All right, we'll swing by the party."
7855,26,2,4,"Ted from 2030: Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however..."
7856,26,2,4,At the party.
7857,26,2,4,"Robin: Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers."
7858,26,2,4,Guy 1: Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?!
7859,26,2,4,Ted from 2030: That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice.
7860,26,2,4,"Lily: Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?"
7861,26,2,4,"Guy 2: Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah!"
7862,26,2,4,"Robin: Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted."
7863,26,2,4,"Guy 2: You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here."
7864,26,2,4,[FLASHBACK]
7865,26,2,4,"Ted: Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building."
7866,26,2,4,Girl: Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.
7867,26,2,4,Ted: I know you would. It's the job.
7868,26,2,4,Guy 2 (to guy 1): Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight.
7869,26,2,4,Guy 1: No way.
7870,26,2,4,"Girl 2: Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?"
7871,26,2,4,"Marshall: I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up."
7872,26,2,4,"Guy 2: Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move."
7873,26,2,4,"Marshall: Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys."
7874,26,2,4,"Girl 2: And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days."
7875,26,2,4,"Marshall: Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now."
7876,26,2,4,Girl 2: You should sue her.
7877,26,2,4,"Marshall: Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?"
7878,26,2,4,Kara: On the grounds of... shut up.
7879,26,2,4,Ted from 2030: That's our Attorney General.
7880,26,2,4,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7881,26,2,4,Lily: See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.
7882,26,2,4,"Robin: Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?"
7883,26,2,4,Guy 2: The girl with the smackable ass.
7884,26,2,4,"Robin: Yes, that's the young lady."

7890,26,2,4,"Ted: Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing."
7891,26,2,4,Girl: Yay!
7892,26,2,4,"Ted: Wait, let me just check with my friend."
7893,26,2,4,Girl: Okay.
7894,26,2,4,"Ted: Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?"
7895,26,2,4,Marshall: Um... only always.
7896,26,2,4,Ted: Let's go.
7897,26,2,4,[END OF FLASHBACK]
7898,26,2,4,"Robin: Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to s*x."
7899,26,2,4,Lily: Did you grow up in that Footloose town?
7900,26,2,4,"Robin: I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories."
7901,26,2,4,"Lily: Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine."
7902,26,2,4,Robin: He's not answering. Calling Marshall.
7903,26,2,4,
7904,26,2,4,"(In a club, Marshall picks up his phone.)"
7905,26,2,4,Marshall: Hello.
7906,26,2,4,"Robin: Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?"
7907,26,2,4,"Marshall: Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working."
7908,26,2,4,"Robin: Uh, okay. Bye. (She hangs up) Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me."
7909,26,2,4,In front of a club.
7910,26,2,4,"Robin: Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating b*st*rd."
7911,26,2,4,Bouncer: You're going to need to refresh my memory.
7912,26,2,4,"Lily: Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?"
7913,26,2,4,"Bouncer: Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory."
7914,26,2,4,Lily: Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.
7915,26,2,4,Robin: So these guys... One of them's an architect.
7916,26,2,4,"Bouncer: Ted Mosby, the architect?"
7917,26,2,4,Robin: That's the one.
7918,26,2,4,"Bouncer: Oh, yeah, he was here."
7919,26,2,4,[FLASHBACK]
7920,26,2,4,"Ted: And then I was all, ""No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time."" And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career."
7921,26,2,4,Girl: I live across the street.
7922,26,2,4,Ted: That is one hell of a non sequitur.
7923,26,2,4,Girl: You want to come over?
7924,26,2,4,"Ted: Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. (The girl jumps on Ted's back)"
7925,26,2,4,"Girl (to the bouncer): I'll see you at book club, Vinny."
7926,26,2,4,Bouncer: Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
7927,26,2,4,Girl: Nice. Giddy up!
7928,26,2,4,"Marshall: Dude, dude, what are you doing?"
7929,26,2,4,Ted: Galloping.
7930,26,2,4,"Marshall: You proved it, all right? The whole ""Ted Mosby, architect"" things works."
7931,26,2,4,Girl: Architects rule! Whoo-hee!
7932,26,2,4,"Marshall: Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted."

7936,26,2,4,Bouncer: I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.
7937,26,2,4,"Lily: Well, I'm out of money."
7938,26,2,4,"Robin: I'm cashed, too."
7939,26,2,4,Bouncer: I'll take your purse.
7940,26,2,4,Robin: My purse?
7941,26,2,4,"Bouncer: Yeah, my girl likes clutches."
7942,26,2,4,"Robin: Okay, fine."
7943,26,2,4,Lily: You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.
7944,26,2,4,Robin: Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?
7945,26,2,4,"Bouncer: The building with the green light, apartment 3-C."
7946,26,2,4,"Lily: Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?"
7947,26,2,4,Robin: Yeah... And steal her purse.
7948,26,2,4,In a building.
7949,26,2,4,"Robin: I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you."
7950,26,2,4,"Lily: 3-C, let's do this. You ready?"
7951,26,2,4,Robin: Should I just kick the door in?
7952,26,2,4,"Lily: Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?"
7953,26,2,4,Robin: I'm the problem.
7954,26,2,4,Lily: What?
7955,26,2,4,Robin: You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.
7956,26,2,4,"Lily: Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted."
7957,26,2,4,Robin: Let's do this.
7958,26,2,4,Lily: Bring it. (They come in)
7959,26,2,4,Robin: What do you think you're...? Barney?
7960,26,2,4,Barney (tied up to the bed): Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.
7961,26,2,4,"Robin: Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?"
7962,26,2,4,Barney: Ted? He's at work.
7963,26,2,4,Robin: How did you get here?
7964,26,2,4,Barney: Awesome story. As per usual.

7966,26,2,4,Girl: How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?
7967,26,2,4,Ted: Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.
7968,26,2,4,"Girl: Yes, she did."
7969,26,2,4,"Barney (coming back in the bar): Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here."
7970,26,2,4,"Ted: Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands."
7971,26,2,4,Girl: Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.
7972,26,2,4,"Barney: Yeah, stay (mouthing ""go"")"
7973,26,2,4,"Ted: Excuse us for one second. (To Barney) Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder."
7974,26,2,4,"Barney: Yeah, you did."
7975,26,2,4,"Ted: Yeah, had to. See ya. (He leaves)"
7976,26,2,4,"Barney (to the girl): Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave."

7991,26,2,4,Robin: But why would you use Ted's name?
7992,26,2,4,"Barney: I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole ""using my real name"" thing."
7993,26,2,4,"Lily: Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay."
7994,26,2,4,Robin: Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.
7995,26,2,4,Lily: This is how people act in relationships.
7996,26,2,4,Robin: And that's why I avoid relationships.
7997,26,2,4,"Lily: Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it."
7998,26,2,4,"Barney: And thus ended this chapter of, ""Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand."" Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower."

8001,26,2,4,Ted from 2030: Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.

8003,26,2,4,Robin: Hey.
8004,26,2,4,Ted: Hey. What are you doing here?

8007,26,2,4,Robin: It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?
8008,26,2,4,Ted: You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?
8009,26,2,4,"Robin: Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through."
8010,26,2,4,Ted: What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.
8011,26,2,4,"Robin: Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?"
8012,26,2,4,"Ted: Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?"
8013,26,2,4,Robin: Obviously. Wow.
8014,26,2,4,Ted: Yes.
8015,26,2,4,"Robin: You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger."
8016,26,2,4,"Ted: You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?"
8017,26,2,4,Ted from 2030: You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. And that night was the first time I showed anyone my first drawing of it.
8018,26,2,4,"Robin: Wow. Ted, this is amazing."
8019,26,2,4,Ted: Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.
8020,26,2,4,"Robin: I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. (They kiss)"

8086,27,2,5,"Barney: See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong."
8087,27,2,5,Lily: It hurts my eyes.
8088,27,2,5,Barney: Yeah. That doesn't go away.
8089,27,2,5,"At the apartment, Marshall arrives."
8090,27,2,5,"Ted: Hey, where have you been?"
8091,27,2,5,Marshall: The Alanis Morissette concert.
8092,27,2,5,Ted: By yourself?
8093,27,2,5,"Marshall: No,actually I went with a friend from law school."
8094,27,2,5,"Robin: Oh,really? Who's this friend?"
8095,27,2,5,Marshall: Brad.
8096,27,2,5,[FLASHBACK. At MacLaren's]
8097,27,2,5,"Brad: Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!"
8098,27,2,5,Marshall: Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.
8099,27,2,5,Brad: Let me guess: you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you.
8100,27,2,5,"Marshall: Yeah, how'd you know?"
8101,27,2,5,Brad: I just got dumped myself.
8102,27,2,5,"Marshall: What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?"
8103,27,2,5,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8104,27,2,5,Ted: You invited him to brunch?
8105,27,2,5,"Marshall: Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?"
8106,27,2,5,"Ted: Yes. That's why I was all ""you invited him to brunch?"""
8107,27,2,5,Marshall: Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?
8108,27,2,5,Ted: Because brunch is kind of...
8109,27,2,5,Robin: Girly.
8110,27,2,5,Marshall: Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?
8111,27,2,5,"Ted: I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn."
8112,27,2,5,"Marshall: I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch."
8113,27,2,5,"At Barney's apartment, Lily cooks breakfast."
8114,27,2,5,"Barney: Uhm, smells delicious."
8115,27,2,5,"Lily: Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up... (Barney puts the breakfast in the trash) What are you doing?"
8116,27,2,5,"Barney: Lily, what was the first rule again?"
8117,27,2,5,"Lily: ""Don't change anything""?"
8118,27,2,5,Barney: And what was the second rule?
8119,27,2,5,Lily: There was no second rule.
8120,27,2,5,Barney: Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.
8121,27,2,5,Lily: I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?
8122,27,2,5,"Barney: Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. Bienvenido to the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says ""our work here is done."" Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de gr&acirc;ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn..."
8123,27,2,5,Lily: Marshall doesn't have p0rn.
8124,27,2,5,"Barney: Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p0rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough."
8125,27,2,5,"Lily: And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper."
8126,27,2,5,"Barney: No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me."
8127,27,2,5,At Popover Pantry.
8128,27,2,5,"Marshall: God, I love brunch."
8129,27,2,5,"Brad: Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous."
8130,27,2,5,"Marshall: This isn't weird, right?"
8131,27,2,5,"Brad: I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny."
8132,27,2,5,Marshall: Right? Right?
8133,27,2,5,"Brad: I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?"
8134,27,2,5,"Marshall: Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying."
8135,27,2,5,Brad: This must be destiny.
8136,27,2,5,Marshall: What are you talking about?
8137,27,2,5,"Brad: I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?"
8138,27,2,5,Marshall: Yeah!
8139,27,2,5,"At Barney's apartment, a girl watches him sleep."
8140,27,2,5,Barney: Hey. Did the cold wake you?
8141,27,2,5,"Girl: No,I've just been watching you sleep."
8142,27,2,5,"Barney: Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel."
8143,27,2,5,Girl: I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.
8144,27,2,5,"Barney: Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to..."
8145,27,2,5,"Girl: I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day."
8146,27,2,5,"Barney: I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look (he shows her his p0rn) Oh, I'm disgusting."
8147,27,2,5,"Girl: Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you."
8148,27,2,5,"Barney: Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um..."
8149,27,2,5,Lily (walking in): Barney... Oh!
8150,27,2,5,Girl: Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?
8151,27,2,5,Barney: What? No. Yes!
8152,27,2,5,Girl: Yes?
8153,27,2,5,Barney: Yes.
8154,27,2,5,Girl: You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.
8155,27,2,5,"Barney: Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? (The girl is gone. To Lily) You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here."
8156,27,2,5,"Lily: Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?"
8157,27,2,5,Barney: She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p0rn.
8158,27,2,5,Lily: Thank you.
8159,27,2,5,"Barney: How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles..."
8160,27,2,5,Lily: I'll do it.
8161,27,2,5,Barney: Really?
8162,27,2,5,"Lily: Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win."
8163,27,2,5,Barney: I'll take it.
8164,27,2,5,
8165,27,2,5,At MacLaren's:
8166,27,2,5,Ted: Mamma mia!?
8167,27,2,5,"Marshall: Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff."
8168,27,2,5,"Ted: No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date."
8169,27,2,5,"Robin: Ooh, third date. You know what that means."
8170,27,2,5,"Marshall: It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show."
8171,27,2,5,Ted: You bros going to get dinner beforehand?
8172,27,2,5,"Marshall: We might grab a steak, yeah."
8173,27,2,5,Ted: Where at?
8174,27,2,5,"Marshall: Café l'amour. (Ted and Robin laugh) Brad says the food is really good there, okay?"
8175,27,2,5,"Robin: Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your ""A"" game. That means no granny panties."
8176,27,2,5,"Marshall: All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway."
8177,27,2,5,Ted: What are you going to wear?
8178,27,2,5,"Marshall: I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... (Ted and Robin laugh) Oh, you know what? Shut up."
8179,27,2,5,"At Barney's apartment, Barney takes breakfast with a girl."
8180,27,2,5,Barney: Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure?
8181,27,2,5,Girl: I just did.
8182,27,2,5,"Lily (walking in): Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?"
8183,27,2,5,"Barney: Lily, I can explain..."
8184,27,2,5,Lily: How could you? In our own home? (She slaps him) You b*st*rd!
8185,27,2,5,Girl: I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...
8186,27,2,5,Lily: Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... (The girl is gone) I was just about to turn on the tears.
8187,27,2,5,Barney: Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.
8188,27,2,5,"Lily: Yeah, that I just always wanted to do."
8189,27,2,5,"Barney: Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change."
8190,27,2,5,"Lily: You know... Oh nah, never mind."
8191,27,2,5,Barney: What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.
8192,27,2,5,"Lily: Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here."
8193,27,2,5,Barney: What did you have in mind?
8194,27,2,5,"(Barney and Lily redecorate the apartment, putting pillows on the couch, changing the living-room carpet, switching the storm-stooper for a plant, adding flowers on the kitchen counter and replacing the p0rn on the bookshelves by books)"
8195,27,2,5,At the apartment.
8196,27,2,5,"Ted: Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning."
8197,27,2,5,"Marshall: Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird."
8198,27,2,5,[FLASHBACK. At café l'amour.]
8199,27,2,5,"Marshall: Oh, you really don't have to do that."
8200,27,2,5,"Brad: No, I insist. You're my guest."
8201,27,2,5,"Marshall: Thanks, Brad."
8202,27,2,5,Brad: Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. (He licks his serviette and cleans Marshall's chin)
8203,27,2,5,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8204,27,2,5,Ted: Woah!
8205,27,2,5,"Robin: Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap."
8206,27,2,5,Marshall: It gets worse.
8207,27,2,5,"[FLASHBACK. At the restaurant, Brad helps Marshall with his coat.]"
8208,27,2,5,"Marshall: No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you."
8209,27,2,5,"Brad: So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?"
8210,27,2,5,Marshall: You want me to go to a wedding with you?
8211,27,2,5,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8212,27,2,5,"Ted: Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like ""Wedding crashers""."
8213,27,2,5,Robin: Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.
8214,27,2,5,Marshall: It gets worse.
8215,27,2,5,[FLASHBACK]
8216,27,2,5,Brad: It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.
8217,27,2,5,Marshall: Vermont?
8218,27,2,5,"Brad: Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro."
8219,27,2,5,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8220,27,2,5,"Ted: You said no, right?"
8221,27,2,5,Marshall: Of course.
8222,27,2,5,[FLASHBACK]
8223,27,2,5,Brad: I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. (Brad starts sobbing)
8224,27,2,5,Marshall: I'll go to Vermont with you.
8225,27,2,5,"Brad: That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat."
8226,27,2,5,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8227,27,2,5,(Ted and Robin laugh)
8228,27,2,5,Ted: I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.
8229,27,2,5,"Marshall: Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?"
8230,27,2,5,"Ted: Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch."
8231,27,2,5,Robin: And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up.
8232,27,2,5,"Marshall: You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it."
8233,27,2,5,Ted: Good man.
8234,27,2,5,"In Barney's bedroom, Lily and Barney put pillows on the bed."
8235,27,2,5,"Lily: Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets."
8236,27,2,5,"Barney: Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?"
8237,27,2,5,Lily (jumping on the bed): Oh. Ooooh!
8238,27,2,5,"Barney: All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?"
8239,27,2,5,"Lily: Oh, I was just going to watch ""Letterman"" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. (Barney turns on a another wall-size TV) Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?"
8240,27,2,5,Barney: Please. (He settles himself on the bed)
8241,27,2,5,Lily: I thought you were going out.
8242,27,2,5,Barney: Eh. After the monologue.
8243,27,2,5,"Ted (from 2030): The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there..."
8244,27,2,5,"(Brad waits on the sidewalk, holding flowers)"
8245,27,2,5,"Marshall: No. No... No. No! No! (On the phone) Ted. Um, Brad got me flowers."
8246,27,2,5,Ted: Hold on. (To Robin) Brad got him flowers. (They laugh) I'm sorry. It just got funny again. (Marshall hangs up)
8247,27,2,5,"Brad: Oh, hey..."
8248,27,2,5,"Marshall: No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would..."
8249,27,2,5,(A girl arrives)
8250,27,2,5,"Girl: Hey,sweetie."
8251,27,2,5,Brad: Hey. (They kiss and Brad give her the flowers)
8252,27,2,5,"Girl: Aww. Hey, Marshall."
8253,27,2,5,"Marshall: Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?"
8254,27,2,5,"Brad: Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you."
8255,27,2,5,"Marshall: Yeah, you should have."
8256,27,2,5,"Brad: Well, I didn't mean to hurt..."
8257,27,2,5,"Marshall: Don't, Brad. Just don't. (He leaves)"
8258,27,2,5,"Kara: Oh, what was with him?"
8259,27,2,5,Brad: I don't know. I think he's in love with me.
8260,27,2,5,"In Barney's bed, Barney and Lily wake up."
8261,27,2,5,Barney: Aaaaaah!
8262,27,2,5,Lily: Aaaaaaaaaaah!
8263,27,2,5,Barney: I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?
8264,27,2,5,Lily: Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.
8265,27,2,5,"Barney: ""Just went to sleep""? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will."
8266,27,2,5,"Lily: Hey,it takes two to cuddle."
8267,27,2,5,"Barney: We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch ""Letterman"", and then slept together and didn't have s*x? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!"
8268,27,2,5,Lily: That's what you think a relationship is?
8269,27,2,5,"Barney: You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go."
8270,27,2,5,"Lily: Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you."
8271,27,2,5,Barney: Uh-uh. You gotta go.
8272,27,2,5,"Lily: Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living."
8273,27,2,5,"Barney: ""A certain standard of living""? You didn't pay a single..."
8274,27,2,5,"Ted (from 2030): And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment."
8275,27,2,5,Ted (from 2030): Marshall ran into Brad again some time later.
8276,27,2,5,"Marshall: Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. (Ted laughs)"
8277,27,2,5,Ted: That was great.
8278,27,2,5,Marshall: Right? Right?
8279,27,2,5,"Brad: Hey, Marshall."
8280,27,2,5,"Marshall: Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?"
8281,27,2,5,"Brad: It's good. (To ted) Hey, I'm uh..."
8282,27,2,5,"Ted: Yeah, I know who you are."
8283,27,2,5,"Brad: Well,I got to go. I got this thing."
8284,27,2,5,"Marshall: Yeah, me too, but more important."
8285,27,2,5,"Brad: So, I guess I'll see you around."
8286,27,2,5,"Marshall: Sure. Sure. (Brad leaves) Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat."
8287,28,2,6,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself."
8288,28,2,6,Robin's apartment.
8289,28,2,6,Lily: It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.
8290,28,2,6,Ted from 2030: And she did find it.
8291,28,2,6,Lily (coming in Robin's): I'm going to be a life coach.
8292,28,2,6,"Ted from 2030: In fact, she found it again and again."
8293,28,2,6,Lily: I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.
8294,28,2,6,Robin (on the phone): Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.
8295,28,2,6,Ted: What is she doing for money through all this?
8296,28,2,6,"Robin: Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau."
8297,28,2,6,"Ted: Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?"
8298,28,2,6,Robin: No.
8299,28,2,6,Big Wave Luau.
8300,28,2,6,Marshall: Here she comes. Here she comes.
8301,28,2,6,"Lily: Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap."
8302,28,2,6,Robin: I'm sorry.
8303,28,2,6,"Barney: Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her)."
8304,28,2,6,Lily: What do you want?
8305,28,2,6,Ted: I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
8306,28,2,6,"Lily: Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo."
8307,28,2,6,Barney: I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
8308,28,2,6,Ted: No.
8309,28,2,6,"Lily: My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks."
8310,28,2,6,"Ted: Robin, nothing to add?"
8311,28,2,6,Robin: No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.
8312,28,2,6,Lily: Thank you.
8313,28,2,6,"Robin: Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday."

8315,28,2,6,MacLaren's.
8316,28,2,6,Marshall: I've never need the beer more than I do right now.
8317,28,2,6,"Ted: I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this."""
8318,28,2,6,"Marshall: Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid."
8319,28,2,6,"Barney: Really? Laid, you say?"
8320,28,2,6,"Marshall: You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s."
8321,28,2,6,Barney: She hot?
8322,28,2,6,"Marshall: Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah."
8323,28,2,6,Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
8324,28,2,6,Robin: A what?
8325,28,2,6,"Barney: A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man."
8326,28,2,6,Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
8327,28,2,6,"Barney: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge."
8328,28,2,6,Marshall: I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...
8329,28,2,6,"Barney: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins."
8330,28,2,6,"Lily (arriving): So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei..."
8331,28,2,6,Marshall: Classic.
8332,28,2,6,"Robin: Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?"
8333,28,2,6,Ted: Yeah. Somebody did just quit.
8334,28,2,6,[FLASHBACK. Ted's office]
8335,28,2,6,"Ted: So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)"
8336,28,2,6,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8337,28,2,6,"Marshall: Dude, that is cold-blooded."
8338,28,2,6,"Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone."
8339,28,2,6,"Robin: Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her."
8340,28,2,6,Ted: It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
8341,28,2,6,"Barney: Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted."
8342,28,2,6,"Ted: So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?"
8343,28,2,6,Lily: What would I be doing?
8344,28,2,6,"Ted: Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant."
8345,28,2,6,Ted's office.
8346,28,2,6,Ted: You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
8347,28,2,6,"Lily: Oh, right, is that the...?"
8348,28,2,6,Ted: Yeah. Here's the model.
8349,28,2,6,Lily: You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.
8350,28,2,6,"Ted: I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it."
8351,28,2,6,Lily: How can he not see it? I mean there's the...
8352,28,2,6,Ted: I know.
8353,28,2,6,Lily: And the way it...
8354,28,2,6,Ted: I know.
8355,28,2,6,Lily: And the two little...
8356,28,2,6,Ted: I know.
8357,28,2,6,Lily: It is just...
8358,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you."
8359,28,2,6,"Ted: Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant."
8360,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: Ah.
8361,28,2,6,Lily: Nice to meet you.
8362,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?"
8363,28,2,6,"Ted: I, uh... I am an architect."
8364,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?"
8365,28,2,6,"Ted: Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams."
8366,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?"
8367,28,2,6,Ted: Absolutely.
8368,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: So you're going to design the...
8369,28,2,6,Ted: Styrofoam trees.
8370,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Once again, with feeling."
8371,28,2,6,Ted: Styrofoam trees.
8372,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: Styrofoam trees!
8373,28,2,6,Ted: Styrofoam trees!
8374,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)"
8375,28,2,6,"Lily: Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)"
8376,28,2,6,Marshall's law school.
8377,28,2,6,"Marshall: Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there."
8378,28,2,6,"Barney: Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin."
8379,28,2,6,"Marshall: Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor."
8380,28,2,6,"Barney: Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?"
8381,28,2,6,"Marshall: Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar."
8382,28,2,6,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa..."
8383,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: Tell me what you want or get out.
8384,28,2,6,Barney: Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.
8385,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.
8386,28,2,6,MacLaren's.
8387,28,2,6,Lily: I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.
8388,28,2,6,"Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop."
8389,28,2,6,Robin: Did you show lily your design?
8390,28,2,6,Ted: No.
8391,28,2,6,Lily: What design?
8392,28,2,6,Ted: It's nothing.
8393,28,2,6,"Robin: It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia."
8394,28,2,6,"Lily: Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers."
8395,28,2,6,"Ted: Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!"
8396,28,2,6,Pr Lewis' apartment.
8397,28,2,6,"Barney: Oh, my god. Incredible."
8398,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: Hmm... C minus.
8399,28,2,6,Barney: C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!
8400,28,2,6,"Pr Lewis: You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive."
8401,28,2,6,Ted's office.
8402,28,2,6,Lily: Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.
8403,28,2,6,"Ted: Okay, I'm done."
8404,28,2,6,Lily: Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.
8405,28,2,6,Ted: Great. Thanks.
8406,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own."
8407,28,2,6,"Ted: Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are."
8408,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: Too green.
8409,28,2,6,Ted: Too green?
8410,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?"
8411,28,2,6,Ted: I can't un-picture it.
8412,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!"
8413,28,2,6,Ted: What? What's gone?
8414,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
8415,28,2,6,"Ted: Well, it's got to be around here somewhere."
8416,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it."
8417,28,2,6,"Ted: Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees."
8418,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing."
8419,28,2,6,"Ted: Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)"
8420,28,2,6,
8421,28,2,6,MacLaren's.
8422,28,2,6,Lily: Hey.
8423,28,2,6,"Ted: Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?"
8424,28,2,6,Lily: That's easy. I took it.
8425,28,2,6,Ted: Why?
8426,28,2,6,Lily: It's simple.
8427,28,2,6,[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university
8428,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present."
8429,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!"
8430,28,2,6,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8431,28,2,6,"Lily: Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball."
8432,28,2,6,Ted: What does his ball have to do with anything?
8433,28,2,6,"Lily: Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean."
8434,28,2,6,"Robin: Hey, guys. What's going on?"
8435,28,2,6,Ted: Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
8436,28,2,6,Robin: Why? Was he being mean?
8437,28,2,6,Ted: You know about this?
8438,28,2,6,Robin: Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?
8439,28,2,6,"Lily: Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis."
8440,28,2,6,Robin: I gave them to you for your birthday.
8441,28,2,6,Ted: So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
8442,28,2,6,"Lily: I prefer to call them ""justice khakis."""
8443,28,2,6,"Ted: That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime."
8444,28,2,6,Lily: So is being mean.
8445,28,2,6,"Ted: Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball."
8446,28,2,6,"Lily: Well, that's why I left a note."
8447,28,2,6,Ted: A note?
8448,28,2,6,"Lily: Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas."
8449,28,2,6,"Ted: Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with."
8450,28,2,6,Lily: I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.
8451,28,2,6,At the apartment.
8452,28,2,6,"Marshall: I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus."
8453,28,2,6,"Barney: I know, I know."
8454,28,2,6,Marshall: You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.
8455,28,2,6,"Barney: Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again."
8456,28,2,6,"Marshall: Just let it go, man. You're making things worse."
8457,28,2,6,"Barney: I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."
8458,28,2,6,Pr Lewis' apartment.
8459,28,2,6,Barney: I think I'm falling in love with you.
8460,28,2,6,"Pr Lewis: Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot."
8461,28,2,6,Barney: What? No.We had s*x yesterday.
8462,28,2,6,"Pr Lewis: Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester."
8463,28,2,6,Ted's office.
8464,28,2,6,"Ted: When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball."
8465,28,2,6,Lily: No.
8466,28,2,6,"Ted: What do you mean, no?"
8467,28,2,6,"Lily: I mean I stand by what I did, Ted."
8468,28,2,6,"Ted: Come on, Lily. We're running out of time."
8469,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: Everybody get in here now!
8470,28,2,6,"Lily: ""Who wants espresso?"""
8471,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note."
8472,28,2,6,"""Dear mr. Druthers,I, your baseball, am leaving. Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back. If not, other things in your office may follow my lead. In fact, I overheard your iPod talking, and he may shuffle off at any minute."" Normally, I would scream at everyone until my voice goes, but maybe that's the wrong reaction here."
8473,28,2,6,Lily: Interesting.
8474,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!"
8475,28,2,6,"Lily: Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod."
8476,28,2,6,Ted: Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.
8477,28,2,6,"Lily: No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time."
8478,28,2,6,"Ted: This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back."
8479,28,2,6,"Lily: All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans."
8480,28,2,6,Ted: No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
8481,28,2,6,"Lily: I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that."
8482,28,2,6,Ted: Then you're fired.
8483,28,2,6,Lily: Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.
8484,28,2,6,MacLaren's.
8485,28,2,6,"Marshall: Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier."
8486,28,2,6,Barney: Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.
8487,28,2,6,Marshall: So you're going back over there?
8488,28,2,6,"Barney: Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name."
8489,28,2,6,Pr Lewis' apartment.
8490,28,2,6,Barney: I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.
8491,28,2,6,"Pr Lewis: Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home."
8492,28,2,6,"Barney: But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year."
8493,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.
8494,28,2,6,Ted's office.
8495,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face."
8496,28,2,6,"Ted: Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily."
8497,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted."
8498,28,2,6,Ted: Lily was mentally deranged.
8499,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.
8500,28,2,6,Ted: Lily was mentally deranged!
8501,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?"
8502,28,2,6,Man: The clients are here.
8503,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: Excellent. Bring them in.
8504,28,2,6,Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.
8505,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building."
8506,28,2,6,Client: That's a pen1s!
8507,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.
8508,28,2,6,Client: We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?
8509,28,2,6,Mr Druthers: Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.
8510,28,2,6,"Client: Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here."
8511,28,2,6,Ted from 2030: The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.
8512,28,2,6,Ted: Wait! We have one more idea for you.
8513,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Ted, what are you doing?"
8514,28,2,6,Ted: I have another design.
8515,28,2,6,"Mr Druthers: Sit down, shut up right now."
8516,28,2,6,Ted: No.
8517,28,2,6,MacLaren's.
8518,28,2,6,Robin: To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!
8519,28,2,6,All: Probably!
8520,28,2,6,"Lily: Congrats, ted."
8521,28,2,6,"Ted: Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you."
8522,28,2,6,"Lily: Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in."
8523,28,2,6,"Ted: Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back..."
8524,28,2,6,"Lily: No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up."
8525,28,2,6,Lily's kindergarten.
8526,28,2,6,"Lily: Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice."
8527,28,2,6,Hospital.
8528,28,2,6,"Robin: Barney! Oh, my god!"
8529,28,2,6,Ted: What happened?
8530,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: He broke his hip.
8531,28,2,6,"Barney: That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine."
8532,28,2,6,"Pr Lewis: No, he's not fine."
8533,28,2,6,"Marshall: Professor Lewis, hi."
8534,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.
8535,28,2,6,"Barney: Yeah, she was."
8536,28,2,6,Pr Lewis: B plus.
8537,28,2,6,"Barney: B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!"
8538,28,2,6,Marshall: Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
8539,29,2,7,"Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself."
8540,29,2,7,Robin's apartment.
8541,29,2,7,Lily: It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.
8542,29,2,7,Ted from 2030: And she did find it.
8543,29,2,7,Lily (coming in Robin's): I'm going to be a life coach.
8544,29,2,7,"Ted from 2030: In fact, she found it again and again."
8545,29,2,7,Lily: I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.
8546,29,2,7,Robin (on the phone): Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band.
8547,29,2,7,Ted: What is she doing for money through all this?
8548,29,2,7,"Robin: Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau."
8549,29,2,7,"Ted: Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?"
8550,29,2,7,Robin: No.
8551,29,2,7,Big Wave Luau.
8552,29,2,7,Marshall: Here she comes. Here she comes.
8553,29,2,7,"Lily: Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap."
8554,29,2,7,Robin: I'm sorry.
8555,29,2,7,"Barney: Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. (Marshall takes a photo of her)."
8556,29,2,7,Lily: What do you want?
8557,29,2,7,Ted: I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.
8558,29,2,7,"Lily: Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo."
8559,29,2,7,Barney: I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
8560,29,2,7,Ted: No.
8561,29,2,7,"Lily: My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks."
8562,29,2,7,"Ted: Robin, nothing to add?"
8563,29,2,7,Robin: No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.
8564,29,2,7,Lily: Thank you.
8565,29,2,7,"Robin: Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday."
8566,29,2,7,CREDIT TITLES
8567,29,2,7,MacLaren's.
8568,29,2,7,Marshall: I've never need the beer more than I do right now.
8569,29,2,7,"Ted: I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, ""dude, my semester is gonna be this."""
8570,29,2,7,"Marshall: Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid."
8571,29,2,7,"Barney: Really? Laid, you say?"
8572,29,2,7,"Marshall: You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s."
8573,29,2,7,Barney: She hot?
8574,29,2,7,"Marshall: Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah."
8575,29,2,7,Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
8576,29,2,7,Robin: A what?
8577,29,2,7,"Barney: A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man."
8578,29,2,7,Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
8579,29,2,7,"Barney: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge."
8580,29,2,7,Marshall: I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...
8581,29,2,7,"Barney: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins."
8582,29,2,7,"Lily (arriving): So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei..."
8583,29,2,7,Marshall: Classic.
8584,29,2,7,"Robin: Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?"
8585,29,2,7,Ted: Yeah. Somebody did just quit.
8586,29,2,7,[FLASHBACK. Ted's office]
8587,29,2,7,"Ted: So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)"
8588,29,2,7,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8589,29,2,7,"Marshall: Dude, that is cold-blooded."
8590,29,2,7,"Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone."
8591,29,2,7,"Robin: Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her."
8592,29,2,7,Ted: It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?
8593,29,2,7,"Barney: Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted."
8594,29,2,7,"Ted: So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?"
8595,29,2,7,Lily: What would I be doing?
8596,29,2,7,"Ted: Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant."
8597,29,2,7,Ted's office.
8598,29,2,7,Ted: You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.
8599,29,2,7,"Lily: Oh, right, is that the...?"
8600,29,2,7,Ted: Yeah. Here's the model.
8601,29,2,7,Lily: You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.
8602,29,2,7,"Ted: I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it."
8603,29,2,7,Lily: How can he not see it? I mean there's the...
8604,29,2,7,Ted: I know.
8605,29,2,7,Lily: And the way it...
8606,29,2,7,Ted: I know.
8607,29,2,7,Lily: And the two little...
8608,29,2,7,Ted: I know.
8609,29,2,7,Lily: It is just...
8610,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you."
8611,29,2,7,"Ted: Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant."
8612,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: Ah.
8613,29,2,7,Lily: Nice to meet you.
8614,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?"
8615,29,2,7,"Ted: I, uh... I am an architect."
8616,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?"
8617,29,2,7,"Ted: Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams."
8618,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?"
8619,29,2,7,Ted: Absolutely.
8620,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: So you're going to design the...
8621,29,2,7,Ted: Styrofoam trees.
8622,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Once again, with feeling."
8623,29,2,7,Ted: Styrofoam trees.
8624,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: Styrofoam trees!
8625,29,2,7,Ted: Styrofoam trees!
8626,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)"
8627,29,2,7,"Lily: Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)"
8628,29,2,7,Marshall's law school.
8629,29,2,7,"Marshall: Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there."
8630,29,2,7,"Barney: Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin."
8631,29,2,7,"Marshall: Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor."
8632,29,2,7,"Barney: Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?"
8633,29,2,7,"Marshall: Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar."
8634,29,2,7,"Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa..."
8635,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: Tell me what you want or get out.
8636,29,2,7,Barney: Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.
8637,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.
8638,29,2,7,MacLaren's.
8639,29,2,7,Lily: I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.
8640,29,2,7,"Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop."
8641,29,2,7,Robin: Did you show lily your design?
8642,29,2,7,Ted: No.
8643,29,2,7,Lily: What design?
8644,29,2,7,Ted: It's nothing.
8645,29,2,7,"Robin: It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia."
8646,29,2,7,"Lily: Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers."
8647,29,2,7,"Ted: Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!"
8648,29,2,7,Pr Lewis' apartment.
8649,29,2,7,"Barney: Oh, my god. Incredible."
8650,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: Hmm... C minus.
8651,29,2,7,Barney: C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!
8652,29,2,7,"Pr Lewis: You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive."
8653,29,2,7,Ted's office.
8654,29,2,7,Lily: Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.
8655,29,2,7,"Ted: Okay, I'm done."
8656,29,2,7,Lily: Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.
8657,29,2,7,Ted: Great. Thanks.
8658,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own."
8659,29,2,7,"Ted: Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are."
8660,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: Too green.
8661,29,2,7,Ted: Too green?
8662,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?"
8663,29,2,7,Ted: I can't un-picture it.
8664,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!"
8665,29,2,7,Ted: What? What's gone?
8666,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
8667,29,2,7,"Ted: Well, it's got to be around here somewhere."
8668,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it."
8669,29,2,7,"Ted: Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees."
8670,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing."
8671,29,2,7,"Ted: Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)"
8672,29,2,7,
8673,29,2,7,MacLaren's.
8674,29,2,7,Lily: Hey.
8675,29,2,7,"Ted: Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?"
8676,29,2,7,Lily: That's easy. I took it.
8677,29,2,7,Ted: Why?
8678,29,2,7,Lily: It's simple.
8679,29,2,7,[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university
8680,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present."
8681,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!"
8682,29,2,7,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8683,29,2,7,"Lily: Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball."
8684,29,2,7,Ted: What does his ball have to do with anything?
8685,29,2,7,"Lily: Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean."
8686,29,2,7,"Robin: Hey, guys. What's going on?"
8687,29,2,7,Ted: Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.
8688,29,2,7,Robin: Why? Was he being mean?
8689,29,2,7,Ted: You know about this?
8690,29,2,7,Robin: Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?
8691,29,2,7,"Lily: Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis."
8692,29,2,7,Robin: I gave them to you for your birthday.
8693,29,2,7,Ted: So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
8694,29,2,7,"Lily: I prefer to call them ""justice khakis."""
8695,29,2,7,"Ted: That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime."
8696,29,2,7,Lily: So is being mean.
8697,29,2,7,"Ted: Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball."
8698,29,2,7,"Lily: Well, that's why I left a note."
8699,29,2,7,Ted: A note?
8700,29,2,7,"Lily: Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas."
8701,29,2,7,"Ted: Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with."
8702,29,2,7,Lily: I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.
8703,29,2,7,At the apartment.
8704,29,2,7,"Marshall: I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus."
8705,29,2,7,"Barney: I know, I know."
8706,29,2,7,Marshall: You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.
8707,29,2,7,"Barney: Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again."
8708,29,2,7,"Marshall: Just let it go, man. You're making things worse."
8709,29,2,7,"Barney: I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."
8710,29,2,7,Pr Lewis' apartment.
8711,29,2,7,Barney: I think I'm falling in love with you.
8712,29,2,7,"Pr Lewis: Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot."
8713,29,2,7,Barney: What? No.We had s*x yesterday.
8714,29,2,7,"Pr Lewis: Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester."
8715,29,2,7,Ted's office.
8716,29,2,7,"Ted: When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, ""who wants espresso?"" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball."
8717,29,2,7,Lily: No.
8718,29,2,7,"Ted: What do you mean, no?"
8719,29,2,7,"Lily: I mean I stand by what I did, Ted."
8720,29,2,7,"Ted: Come on, Lily. We're running out of time."
8721,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: Everybody get in here now!
8722,29,2,7,"Lily: ""Who wants espresso?"""
8723,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note."
8724,29,2,7,"""Dear mr. Druthers,I, your baseball, am leaving. Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back. If not, other things in your office may follow my lead. In fact, I overheard your iPod talking, and he may shuffle off at any minute."" Normally, I would scream at everyone until my voice goes, but maybe that's the wrong reaction here."
8725,29,2,7,Lily: Interesting.
8726,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever ""allegedly"" did!"
8727,29,2,7,"Lily: Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod."
8728,29,2,7,Ted: Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.
8729,29,2,7,"Lily: No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time."
8730,29,2,7,"Ted: This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back."
8731,29,2,7,"Lily: All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans."
8732,29,2,7,Ted: No. You'll give it back or you're fired.
8733,29,2,7,"Lily: I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that."
8734,29,2,7,Ted: Then you're fired.
8735,29,2,7,Lily: Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.
8736,29,2,7,MacLaren's.
8737,29,2,7,"Marshall: Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier."
8738,29,2,7,Barney: Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.
8739,29,2,7,Marshall: So you're going back over there?
8740,29,2,7,"Barney: Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the ""cougar"" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name."
8741,29,2,7,Pr Lewis' apartment.
8742,29,2,7,Barney: I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.
8743,29,2,7,"Pr Lewis: Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home."
8744,29,2,7,"Barney: But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year."
8745,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers.
8746,29,2,7,Ted's office.
8747,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face."
8748,29,2,7,"Ted: Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily."
8749,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted."
8750,29,2,7,Ted: Lily was mentally deranged.
8751,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.
8752,29,2,7,Ted: Lily was mentally deranged!
8753,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?"
8754,29,2,7,Man: The clients are here.
8755,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: Excellent. Bring them in.
8756,29,2,7,Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.
8757,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building."
8758,29,2,7,Client: That's a pen1s!
8759,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.
8760,29,2,7,Client: We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?
8761,29,2,7,Mr Druthers: Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.
8762,29,2,7,"Client: Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here."
8763,29,2,7,Ted from 2030: The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.
8764,29,2,7,Ted: Wait! We have one more idea for you.
8765,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Ted, what are you doing?"
8766,29,2,7,Ted: I have another design.
8767,29,2,7,"Mr Druthers: Sit down, shut up right now."
8768,29,2,7,Ted: No.
8769,29,2,7,MacLaren's.
8770,29,2,7,Robin: To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!
8771,29,2,7,All: Probably!
8772,29,2,7,"Lily: Congrats, ted."
8773,29,2,7,"Ted: Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you."
8774,29,2,7,"Lily: Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in."
8775,29,2,7,"Ted: Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back..."
8776,29,2,7,"Lily: No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up."
8777,29,2,7,Lily's kindergarten.
8778,29,2,7,"Lily: Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice."
8779,29,2,7,Hospital.
8780,29,2,7,"Robin: Barney! Oh, my god!"
8781,29,2,7,Ted: What happened?
8782,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: He broke his hip.
8783,29,2,7,"Barney: That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine."
8784,29,2,7,"Pr Lewis: No, he's not fine."
8785,29,2,7,"Marshall: Professor Lewis, hi."
8786,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.
8787,29,2,7,"Barney: Yeah, she was."
8788,29,2,7,Pr Lewis: B plus.
8789,29,2,7,"Barney: B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that ""A""!"
8790,29,2,7,Marshall: Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
8791,30,2,8,The apartment.
8792,30,2,8,"Ted from 2030: And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together."
8793,30,2,8,"Lily: Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!"
8794,30,2,8,"Marshall: Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer."
8795,30,2,8,Lily: Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?
8796,30,2,8,"Marshall: Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?"
8797,30,2,8,Ted from 2030: And things were back to normal... Almost.
8798,30,2,8,"Lily: You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes."
8799,30,2,8,"Marshall: Oh, uhm..."
8800,30,2,8,"Lily: I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?"
8801,30,2,8,Marshall: Really?
8802,30,2,8,"Lily: Of course, I love you."
8803,30,2,8,"Marshall: No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? ""Do you still wanna?"" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying."
8804,30,2,8,"Lily (getting down on one knee): Marshall Eriksen, will you ma..."
8805,30,2,8,"Marshall: No, no, no, no, no, no."
8806,30,2,8,Lily: What?!
8807,30,2,8,"Marshall: You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech."
8808,30,2,8,Lily: Do you remember your proposal to me? (She puts her hand on her eye)
8809,30,2,8,Marshall: I had a speech prepared.
8810,30,2,8,Lily: What do you want to hear?
8811,30,2,8,"Marshall: I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that."
8812,30,2,8,Lily: Marshall... You are good-looking...
8813,30,2,8,Marshall: Thank you.
8814,30,2,8,Lily: Funny...
8815,30,2,8,"Marshall: Oh, thanks."
8816,30,2,8,Lily: Smart...
8817,30,2,8,Marshall: And a few tears wouldn't hurt.
8818,30,2,8,"Lily: Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?"
8819,30,2,8,"Marshall: I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out."
8820,30,2,8,"Lily: Yeah, right. (They kiss)"
8821,30,2,8,CREDIT TITLES
8822,30,2,8,The apartment. Marshall and Lily straighten after they had s*x on the kitchen floor.
8823,30,2,8,Marshall: I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.
8824,30,2,8,"Lily: I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!"
8825,30,2,8,"Marshall: I know, I know."
8826,30,2,8,"Ted from 2030: It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family."
8827,30,2,8,"[FLASHBACK]Marshall (on the phone): Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off. What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that? What do you call that? I think that that's a little strong. I can't even believe you would use a word like that. Geez, Grandma."
8828,30,2,8,[END OF FLASHBACK]
8829,30,2,8,"Lily: Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?"
8830,30,2,8,"Marshall: It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?"
8831,30,2,8,"Lily: God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today."
8832,30,2,8,Marshall: Yeah...
8833,30,2,8,Metro News One station.
8834,30,2,8,Robin: Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.
8835,30,2,8,Marshall: Robin! Stop the news!
8836,30,2,8,Woman: What the hell?
8837,30,2,8,Robin: It's okay. They're my friends.
8838,30,2,8,Lily: We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.
8839,30,2,8,"Robin: Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work."
8840,30,2,8,"Woman: It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight. (To the cameraman) Hey, Mike... You can read, right?"
8841,30,2,8,"Mike: Yeah, I'm the best at reading."
8842,30,2,8,Robin: Let's go to Atlantic City!
8843,30,2,8,All: Yeah!
8844,30,2,8,Ted's office.
8845,30,2,8,"Ted: You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?"
8846,30,2,8,Lily: I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.
8847,30,2,8,"Ted: Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager."
8848,30,2,8,"Lily: Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?"
8849,30,2,8,Ted: Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!
8850,30,2,8,Marshall: Yeah!
8851,30,2,8,"Ted: Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?"
8852,30,2,8,Marshall: You got it.
8853,30,2,8,Pedicure's place.
8854,30,2,8,"Barney: Hey, guys."
8855,30,2,8,Ted: Wow. A pedicure.
8856,30,2,8,"Barney: Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine."
8857,30,2,8,Lily: We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!
8858,30,2,8,"Barney: Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?"
8859,30,2,8,Marshall: So are you in or not?
8860,30,2,8,"Barney: Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done."
8861,30,2,8,"Marshall: No, we got to get going to the..."
8862,30,2,8,"Lily: Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here..."
8863,30,2,8,Ted from 2030: So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City.
8864,30,2,8,A casino in Atlantic City.
8865,30,2,8,Lily: Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.
8866,30,2,8,Marshall: And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.
8867,30,2,8,"Barney: Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend."
8868,30,2,8,Ted: You been here before?
8869,30,2,8,"Barney: Oh, uh, once or twice."
8870,30,2,8,Chinese 1: Barney!
8871,30,2,8,"Barney: Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe."
8872,30,2,8,Lily: The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?
8873,30,2,8,Marshall: I'm ready. Let's get married.
8874,30,2,8,"Barney, Ted and Robin: Yeah."
8875,30,2,8,"Lily: Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married."
8876,30,2,8,"Robin: Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey."
8877,30,2,8,"Lily: Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit."
8878,30,2,8,"Robin: Oh, really? Thanks."
8879,30,2,8,"Lily: Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me."
8880,30,2,8,Robin: Done. (She leaves)
8881,30,2,8,Lily: I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. (She leaves)
8882,30,2,8,Ted: You guys want to go gamble?
8883,30,2,8,"Marshall: No, we got to go get the veil."
8884,30,2,8,"Ted: Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one."
8885,30,2,8,"Marshall: Yeah, okay."
8886,30,2,8,"Barney: No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves)"
8887,30,2,8,"Ted: So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy."
8888,30,2,8,Marshall: Thanks.
8889,30,2,8,Ted: How are you feeling?
8890,30,2,8,"Marshall: Great, a little nervous."
8891,30,2,8,Ted: Yeah? Craps?
8892,30,2,8,Marshall: Not that nervous.
8893,30,2,8,"Ted: No, I mean do you want to play craps."
8894,30,2,8,"Marshall: Oh, yeah, definitely."
8895,30,2,8,"Barney: Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?"
8896,30,2,8,Ted: What did you just say?
8897,30,2,8,"Marshall: Barney, no."
8898,30,2,8,"Barney: Marshall, I'm your best man."
8899,30,2,8,Marshall: You're not my best man.
8900,30,2,8,Ted: Right here.
8901,30,2,8,"Barney: And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend."
8902,30,2,8,Marshall: You're not my best friend.
8903,30,2,8,Ted: Right here.
8904,30,2,8,"Marshall: Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes."
8905,30,2,8,Ted: 18 minutes...
8906,30,2,8,18 minutes later.
8907,30,2,8,"Lily: Oh, good. Did you get the veil?"
8908,30,2,8,Barney: Of course.
8909,30,2,8,Marshall: And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.
8910,30,2,8,Ted: Dude!
8911,30,2,8,Barney: Unbelievable!
8912,30,2,8,Marshall: We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.
8913,30,2,8,Lily: Your last lap dance ever.
8914,30,2,8,Marshall: Right. What?
8915,30,2,8,"Robin (arriving, wearing a ""shirt boobs""): Okay, I'm here. Right?"
8916,30,2,8,"Ted: Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City."
8917,30,2,8,Robin: Does it smell like strippers in here?
8918,30,2,8,"Ted: That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!"
8919,30,2,8,"Lily: Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)"
8920,30,2,8,"Marshall: Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing."
8921,30,2,8,Lily: Hi. We're here to get married.
8922,30,2,8,Woman: Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.
8923,30,2,8,Marshall: We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.
8924,30,2,8,"Woman: Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?"
8925,30,2,8,"Robin: Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own."
8926,30,2,8,Ted (looking at Robin's shirt): What?
8927,30,2,8,Woman: It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.
8928,30,2,8,"Lily: No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point."
8929,30,2,8,"Woman: Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five."
8930,30,2,8,"Ted: Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time."
8931,30,2,8,"Woman: Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel."
8932,30,2,8,Lily: Have you been outside?
8933,30,2,8,Ted: There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.
8934,30,2,8,"Marshall: You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?"
8935,30,2,8,"Woman: About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
8936,30,2,8,Barney: Bright side: the bachelor party continues!
8937,30,2,8,"Ted: Yes! Continues? You mean ""start."" He means ""start."" We went to a strip club."
8938,30,2,8,
8939,30,2,8,Woman: Twenty-seven.
8940,30,2,8,Lily: Is there any way that we could get a license today?
8941,30,2,8,"Woman: You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason."
8942,30,2,8,"Lily: Well, we're in love."
8943,30,2,8,Marshall: What better reason could there be?
8944,30,2,8,"Woman: The last one I heard was, ""I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"" but, you know, give yours a whirl."
8945,30,2,8,Ted from 2030: So we went to the courthouse.
8946,30,2,8,Courthouse.
8947,30,2,8,"Marshall: God, this is taking forever."
8948,30,2,8,Robin (to Ted): Can't believe they're getting married.
8949,30,2,8,"Ted: I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City..."
8950,30,2,8,"Robin: Ted, up here."
8951,30,2,8,Ted: Uhm?
8952,30,2,8,Robin: You were just staring at my shirt boobs.
8953,30,2,8,"Ted: No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt."
8954,30,2,8,"Chinese 2: Hey, it's Barney! Barney!"
8955,30,2,8,Barney: Hi.
8956,30,2,8,Chinese 2: (speaks Chinese language)...suit up! (both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!
8957,30,2,8,Barney: See you.
8958,30,2,8,Ted: What the hell was that?
8959,30,2,8,Barney: A... Chinese guy?
8960,30,2,8,"Marshall: Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love."
8961,30,2,8,Woman 2: Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.
8962,30,2,8,"Lily: Oh, really?!"
8963,30,2,8,"Woman 2: Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that."
8964,30,2,8,"Lily: Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?"
8965,30,2,8,Woman 2: Absolutely.
8966,30,2,8,Lily: Really?!
8967,30,2,8,"Woman 2: Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't."
8968,30,2,8,Marshall: Why are you doing this to us?!
8969,30,2,8,Woman 2: 'Cause you're on Candid Camera!
8970,30,2,8,Robin: Really?!
8971,30,2,8,Woman 2: Is what I would say...
8972,30,2,8,Marshall: You know what? We get it.
8973,30,2,8,"In a corridor, on a bench."
8974,30,2,8,"Lily: Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long."
8975,30,2,8,(Image fading in old people on the bench)
8976,30,2,8,"Marshall: Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds."
8977,30,2,8,Barney: Vultures.
8978,30,2,8,Ted (to Robin): Psst. (They move away)
8979,30,2,8,Robin: What? Here?
8980,30,2,8,Ted: Yeah. Got a little time to kill.
8981,30,2,8,"Robin: Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?"
8982,30,2,8,Ted: No. A little.
8983,30,2,8,Robin: Something is seriously wrong with you.
8984,30,2,8,"Ted: So what, is that a no?"
8985,30,2,8,"Robin: All right, let's do it."
8986,30,2,8,"Ted: All right. Um, also...?"
8987,30,2,8,"Robin: Yes, I'll leave it on."
8988,30,2,8,Ted: Sweet.
8989,30,2,8,"Barney: Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen."
8990,30,2,8,"Lily: Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative."
8991,30,2,8,"Barney: You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet."
8992,30,2,8,"Lily: Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!"
8993,30,2,8,Judge's office. Lily turns on her musical bouquet.
8994,30,2,8,Judge: Turn it off.
8995,30,2,8,Lily: Okay. May we please get married today?
8996,30,2,8,"Judge: Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?"
8997,30,2,8,Lily: What was what?
8998,30,2,8,Judge: That little look. What was that?
8999,30,2,8,Marshall: A look of love.
9000,30,2,8,"Judge: You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?"
9001,30,2,8,"Marshall: You know, what's thick? what's thin?"
9002,30,2,8,"Lily: Yeah, I mean, all... yeah."
9003,30,2,8,Marshall: I have.
9004,30,2,8,"Judge: All right, what was that look? What's going on?"
9005,30,2,8,Barney: They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.
9006,30,2,8,"Ted: No, we're not."
9007,30,2,8,"Barney: Yeah, we are. He's a judge."
9008,30,2,8,Ted: Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?
9009,30,2,8,"Barney: Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it."
9010,30,2,8,Casino.
9011,30,2,8,Marshall: Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.
9012,30,2,8,"Lily: No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today."
9013,30,2,8,"Marshall: Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license."
9014,30,2,8,Lily: Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.
9015,30,2,8,"Ted: Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?"
9016,30,2,8,Lily: This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?
9017,30,2,8,Woman: This is my machine.
9018,30,2,8,Marshall: I should go talk to her.
9019,30,2,8,"Robin: No, let me."
9020,30,2,8,Ted: Blackjack?
9021,30,2,8,Marshall: Yeah.
9022,30,2,8,"Lily: Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer."
9023,30,2,8,"Robin: Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?"
9024,30,2,8,"Lily: Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long."
9025,30,2,8,Robin: Nobody's gonna do that.
9026,30,2,8,"Lily: No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight."
9027,30,2,8,"Robin: Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt..."
9028,30,2,8,"Marshall: Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain."
9029,30,2,8,Lily: What?
9030,30,2,8,Ted: Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?
9031,30,2,8,"Lily: See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?"
9032,30,2,8,"Captain: I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000."
9033,30,2,8,Marshall: What?
9034,30,2,8,"Lily: Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it."
9035,30,2,8,Barney: I can get us that money.
9036,30,2,8,Ted: How?
9037,30,2,8,Barney: Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?
9038,30,2,8,Ted: Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?
9039,30,2,8,"Barney: Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called ""Shing Hasabu Shing"". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money."
9040,30,2,8,"Robin: No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away."
9041,30,2,8,"Barney: Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it."
9042,30,2,8,"Ted from 2030: Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did."
9043,30,2,8,Lily: Do you understand what's happening?
9044,30,2,8,Ted: Not a clue.
9045,30,2,8,Robin: Do you think he's winning?
9046,30,2,8,Ted: I don't even know if he's playing.
9047,30,2,8,"Marshall: Wait, I get it. I understand this game."

9073,30,2,8,Ted: You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?
9074,30,2,8,"Lily: Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work."
9075,30,2,8,"Marshall: So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter."

9312,31,2,9,"Marshall: You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her."
9313,31,2,9,(Ted and Robin in apartment talking)
9314,31,2,9,"Ted: Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest."
9315,31,2,9,Robin: Thanks Ted.
9316,31,2,9,"Ted: Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is."
9317,31,2,9,Robin: I say we just move on.
9318,31,2,9,"Ted: In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding."
9319,31,2,9,"Ted: Ah, Canada in June. That's great."
9320,31,2,9,Ted: Sit down or buffet.
9321,31,2,9,Robin: Um...
9322,31,2,9,Ted: Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.
9323,31,2,9,"Robin: No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc."
9324,31,2,9,Ted: Hm. Band of DJ?
9325,31,2,9,"Robin: String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound."
9326,31,2,9,Ted: How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.
9327,31,2,9,Ted: Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.
9328,31,2,9,Ted: Color scheme?
9329,31,2,9,Robin: Dusty rose and sienna.
9330,31,2,9,Ted: Husband's name?
9331,31,2,9,Robin: Um.
9332,31,2,9,Ted: You were never married.
9333,31,2,9,Robin: Yes I was.
9334,31,2,9,Ted: No you weren't.
9335,31,2,9,Robin: How do you know?
9336,31,2,9,Ted: I looked it up at the library.
9337,31,2,9,Robin: What library?
9338,31,2,9,Ted: The one on 5th.
9339,31,2,9,Robin: When did you go?
9340,31,2,9,Ted: Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....
9341,31,2,9,"Robin: I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?"
9342,31,2,9,Ted: I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.
9343,31,2,9,"(Robin looks at Ted) Ted: Fine, Marshall looked it up in school."
9344,31,2,9,Robin: You told Marshall?
9345,31,2,9,Ted: You lied to me!
9346,31,2,9,"Robin: See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret."
9347,31,2,9,Ted: But it was a fake secret.
9348,31,2,9,"Robin: Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too."
9349,31,2,9,"Ted: Testing me, that's insane."
9350,31,2,9,"Robin: Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?"
9351,31,2,9,Ted: That wasn't a real secret.
9352,31,2,9,"Robin: Yeah, but it could have been."
9353,31,2,9,Ted: You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.
9354,31,2,9,Robin: He moved there for business.
9355,31,2,9,INT. MACLAREN'S
9356,31,2,9,"(Lily and Marshall sit at booth, Barney walks up to them)"
9357,31,2,9,"Barney: You, you got something to say to me?"
9358,31,2,9,Marshall: What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.
9359,31,2,9,Marshall: How could you possibly know that?
9360,31,2,9,"(Barney looks over at Lily, Lily squirms in her seat)"
9361,31,2,9,(flashback of Lily and Marshall talking in bed) Lily: And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed. What about you?
9362,31,2,9,"Marshall: Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine..."
9363,31,2,9,(Lily looks away slowly looking disturbed)
9364,31,2,9,(back to present scene)
9365,31,2,9,"Marshall: You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you."
9366,31,2,9,Barney: Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.
9367,31,2,9,Lily: Barney gets three slaps.
9368,31,2,9,Marshall: Three?
9369,31,2,9,Lily: One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.
9370,31,2,9,"(Barney slaps Marshall three times in quick succession, Marshall looks like he's going to cry)"
9371,31,2,9,Barney: Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.
9372,31,2,9,INT. APARTMENT
9373,31,2,9,(Ted and Robin talking)
9374,31,2,9,Ted: I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.
9375,31,2,9,"Robin: I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine."
9376,31,2,9,"(front door opens, Barney, Lily and Marshall run in)"
9377,31,2,9,Barney: So I just got a very interesting phone call.
9378,31,2,9,Ted: What are you talking about?
9379,31,2,9,Barney: I know Robin's secret.
9380,31,2,9,Robin: What?
9381,31,2,9,"Barney: That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now."
9382,31,2,9,(Barney sits down at table and opens laptop)
9383,31,2,9,"Barney: Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."
9384,31,2,9,Ted: Yeah. No I don't.
9385,31,2,9,(Ted closes laptop)
9386,31,2,9,Barney: What?
9387,31,2,9,Ted: Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.
9388,31,2,9,"Barney: Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!"
9389,31,2,9,(Barney opens up laptop)
9390,31,2,9,"Barney: Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."
9391,31,2,9,"Robin: Barney, don't, okay."
9392,31,2,9,"Barney: Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right."
9393,31,2,9,"Ted: No, Barney, I said we're not watching this."
9394,31,2,9,(Ted closes laptop)
9395,31,2,9,"Robin: No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it."
9396,31,2,9,(Barney opens laptop)
9397,31,2,9,Lily: Are you as terrified as I am?
9398,31,2,9,Marshall: I don't wanna get slapped again.
9399,31,2,9,Robin: I wanna stress that I was young.
9400,31,2,9,Barney: Yeah you were.
9401,31,2,9,Robin: And I didn't know any better.
9402,31,2,9,Barney: They never do.
9403,31,2,9,Robin: And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
9404,31,2,9,Barney: It always does.
9405,31,2,9,(video plays on laptop showing Robin Sparkles dressed as a school girl in a classroom with a teacher)
9406,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?"
9407,31,2,9,(Robin Sparkles bites her lip)
9408,31,2,9,(Barney stops video)
9409,31,2,9,Ted: Oh my God.
9410,31,2,9,"Barney: Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock."
9411,31,2,9,(Barney slaps Marshall)
9412,31,2,9,Robin: What the hell was that?
9413,31,2,9,"Ted: I slap bet Marshall that you did p0rn, so I win."
9414,31,2,9,"Robin: p0rn? I wish it was p0rn, it would be less embarrassing."
9415,31,2,9,(Robin plays video)
9416,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: I know, how about I sing you a song!"
9417,31,2,9,(Robin Sparkles starts skipping)
9418,31,2,9,"(Ted, Barney, Lily and Marshall look at the laptop with mouths agape, video keeps playing while everyone watches and makes comments)"
9419,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori."
9420,31,2,9,Robin: I was a teenage pop star in Canada.
9421,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about."
9422,31,2,9,Lily: This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
9423,31,2,9,Marshall: That's you?
9424,31,2,9,Robin: Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.
9425,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today."
9426,31,2,9,Marshall: This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?
9427,31,2,9,Robin: The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.
9428,31,2,9,"Marshall: Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p0rn."
9429,31,2,9,Lily: And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.
9430,31,2,9,Marshall: Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation
9431,31,2,9,"Ted: Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping."
9432,31,2,9,Robin Sparkles: Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend.
9433,31,2,9,"Lily: OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity."
9434,31,2,9,"Marshall, Ted: Cool."
9435,31,2,9,Ted: Go with the 10 now.
9436,31,2,9,"Robin: No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?"
9437,31,2,9,"Ted: Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy."
9438,31,2,9,Barney: I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.
9439,31,2,9,Robin: Good call.
9440,31,2,9,Ted: Horrible call.
9441,31,2,9,(Marshall reaches over and Barney flinches)
9442,31,2,9,"Marshall: Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun."
9443,31,2,9,Robin Sparkles: Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall
9444,31,2,9,"Lily: So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?"
9445,31,2,9,"Barney: Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket."
9446,31,2,9,"Ted: Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone."
9447,31,2,9,"Robin: You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice."
9448,31,2,9,(Ted and Robin kiss)
9449,31,2,9,"Lily, Marshall, Barney: Aw."
9450,31,2,9,(Marshall slaps Barney)
9451,31,2,9,Marshall: That's one.
9452,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!"
9453,31,2,9,Barney: Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.
9454,31,2,9,Robin Sparkles: There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me.
9455,31,2,9,Robot: But don't forget the robot.
9456,31,2,9,Marshall: The robot! Hey!
9457,31,2,9,(Marshall and Robin high-five)
9458,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: But, baby, I don't wanna wait."
9459,31,2,9,"Ted: No, she doesn't wanna wait."
9460,31,2,9,"Robin Sparkles: I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall (today). Let's go to the mall (today)..."
9461,32,2,10,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold."
9462,32,2,10,Barney comes into the apartment.
9463,32,2,10,"Barney: Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?"
9464,32,2,10,Ted: - Nope.
9465,32,2,10,Robin: - No.
9466,32,2,10,"Later, Barney comes back.."
9467,32,2,10,"Barney: Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?"
9468,32,2,10,Ted: - Nope.
9469,32,2,10,"Marshall, lily, Robin: - No, thanks."
9470,32,2,10,And again...
9471,32,2,10,"Barney: One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?"
9472,32,2,10,Marshall: Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.
9473,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off): It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman."
9474,32,2,10,Barney is at the bar talking to a girl
9475,32,2,10,Barney:  Hi. Have you met me?
9476,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off): Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements."
9477,32,2,10,Barney comes into the apartment.
9478,32,2,10,Tous: - No.
9479,32,2,10,"Barney: Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React."
9480,32,2,10,Tous: - Hey!
9481,32,2,10,Robin: - You have a brother?
9482,32,2,10,"Barney: - Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever."
9483,32,2,10,Lily: He's exactly like Barney.
9484,32,2,10,Barney: That's what I just said.
9485,32,2,10,"Ted: Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay."
9486,32,2,10,"Robin: Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome."
9487,32,2,10,"Ted: Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here."
9488,32,2,10,Someone knock on the door and Barney opens
9489,32,2,10,Barney Here he is.
9490,32,2,10,"James: What up, New York."
9491,32,2,10,Robin: Thanks for the heads up.
9492,32,2,10,Générique
9493,32,2,10,"Robin: How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?"
9494,32,2,10,"Ted: Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face."
9495,32,2,10,"Marshall: Yeah, so now the wedding's back on."
9496,32,2,10,"Lily: Anyway, James, how have you been?"
9497,32,2,10,"James: Awesome, as per ""yoozh."" I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.""Legendarier."" And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five."
9498,32,2,10,"Barney: Is ""gimme five"" back?"
9499,32,2,10,"James: Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning."
9500,32,2,10,"Barney: Guys, ""gimme five"" is back!"
9501,32,2,10,"Ted: Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin."
9502,32,2,10,Robin: - Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
9503,32,2,10,"James: - You, too."
9504,32,2,10,"Robin: So, I have to ask, there's a story here."
9505,32,2,10,Barney and James: Please.
9506,32,2,10,"Flashback - In 1982, Barney and James are kids and are sitting on the cough."
9507,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off): The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years."
9508,32,2,10,"Mere: Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?"
9509,32,2,10,James: - Coffee?
9510,32,2,10,"Mere: - No, James, I ate chocolate ice cream. But I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you. Can't smoke without my coffee."
9511,32,2,10,In 1984
9512,32,2,10,"Mere: I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things."
9513,32,2,10,In 1986
9514,32,2,10,Mere: Stop asking me! You know what you two are? You're little racists!
9515,32,2,10,End of Flashback
9516,32,2,10,Ted: So what are you guys gonna do tonight?
9517,32,2,10,"Barney: I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now."
9518,32,2,10,Ted: Okay.
9519,32,2,10,"Marshall: Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?"
9520,32,2,10,"James: Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement. But I will say this: way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have."
9521,32,2,10,Lily: And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.
9522,32,2,10,Barney: It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.
9523,32,2,10,James:  He was a little bit way into black guys.
9524,32,2,10,"Tes (voix off): Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist."
9525,32,2,10,Flashbach. James and Barney are et the bar.
9526,32,2,10,James: Whoa. Your scarf... it is fierce!
9527,32,2,10,Women: Thanks. H & M.
9528,32,2,10,"James: What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- ""ulous."" Okay?"
9529,32,2,10,Ted (voix off): And Barney always returned the favor.
9530,32,2,10,"Barney: Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?"
9531,32,2,10,"Man: Oh, my God, I do!"
9532,32,2,10,"Barney:  Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?"
9533,32,2,10,End of flashback.
9534,32,2,10,"Barney: Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense."
9535,32,2,10,"James: You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?"
9536,32,2,10,Ted: - No.
9537,32,2,10,Lily: - Jammies.
9538,32,2,10,Marshall: Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...I have warm soup belly.
9539,32,2,10,"James: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?"
9540,32,2,10,"Tous: - Hell, yeah!"
9541,32,2,10,"James: Can I get a ""hell, yeah""?"
9542,32,2,10,"Tous: - Hell, yeah!"
9543,32,2,10,"James: Can I get a ""woo-woo""?"
9544,32,2,10,Tous: - Woo-woo!
9545,32,2,10,James: Go do it for Wyoming!
9546,32,2,10,Tous: Yes!
9547,32,2,10,James: Testify!
9548,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off): So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out."
9549,32,2,10,They get into a bar.
9550,32,2,10,"Barney: Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?"
9551,32,2,10,"James: Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man."
9552,32,2,10,Barney: I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?
9553,32,2,10,"James: Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?"
9554,32,2,10,Barney: - Let's ride.
9555,32,2,10,"James: - Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!"
9556,32,2,10,"Women: - Get off me, you pig!"
9557,32,2,10,"Barney: - Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers."
9558,32,2,10,James: - What? What?
9559,32,2,10,Barney: - What? What?
9560,32,2,10,James: Cool.
9561,32,2,10,Barney: Let me know if he bothers you again.
9562,32,2,10,Women: Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.
9563,32,2,10,Barney: Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.
9564,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off): Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs."
9565,32,2,10,James: - Break.
9566,32,2,10,Barney: - Boiling hot.
9567,32,2,10,Ted (voix off): Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.
9568,32,2,10,"James: - Hey! - Hi, how are ya?"
9569,32,2,10,James and Barney: Have you met my brother?
9570,32,2,10,"Barney: Oh, hello. Have a drink."
9571,32,2,10,James: Nice to meet ya.
9572,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off): Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma."
9573,32,2,10,"James: I wish I would've worn sneakers. I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied."
9574,32,2,10,Lily: I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this.
9575,32,2,10,Robin: Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.
9576,32,2,10,"Lily: Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo."
9577,32,2,10,"Man: Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?"
9578,32,2,10,"Lily: Oh, please go sweat on someone else."
9579,32,2,10,Marshall: Poor guy.
9580,32,2,10,Lily: Poor guy? Poor my boobs.
9581,32,2,10,"Marshall: Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him."
9582,32,2,10,"Lily: Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside."
9583,32,2,10,"Robin: Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end."
9584,32,2,10,"Ted: ""Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have s*x with me."" Waa."
9585,32,2,10,"Marshall: ""Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but can't order because they'll be made fun of."""
9586,32,2,10,Ted: - Dude.
9587,32,2,10,Marshall: - They're delicious!
9588,32,2,10,Man: Excuse me. Join me in a shot?
9589,32,2,10,"James: Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can."
9590,32,2,10,"Lily: You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight."
9591,32,2,10,"Marshall: Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are."
9592,32,2,10,"Ted: He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship?"
9593,32,2,10,Robin: No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.
9594,32,2,10,Marshall: Look at that. He's texting!
9595,32,2,10,"Ted: Oh, my God! He is in a couple."
9596,32,2,10,Lily: This is gonna kill Barney.
9597,32,2,10,Barney: What's gonna kill me? What's going on?
9598,32,2,10,Marshall: B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?
9599,32,2,10,"Barney: No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean."
9600,32,2,10,"Ted: We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous."
9601,32,2,10,"Barney: That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had s*x with anyone in a bathroom stall."
9602,32,2,10,"Robin: And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting."
9603,32,2,10,"Barney: No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex..."
9604,32,2,10,"James: Hey, bro."
9605,32,2,10,Barney: Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.
9606,32,2,10,James: Why?
9607,32,2,10,Barney: I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.
9608,32,2,10,"James: No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?"
9609,32,2,10,"Barney: I got... Who is this? And the answer better be: ""I don't remember his name."""
9610,32,2,10,James: That is Tom. And he's my fiancé.
9611,32,2,10,
9612,32,2,10,James meets Barney at McLaren's
9613,32,2,10,James: Hey.
9614,32,2,10,Barney: I don't support this.
9615,32,2,10,James: Gay marriage?
9616,32,2,10,"Barney: Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!"
9617,32,2,10,"James: Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love."
9618,32,2,10,"Barney: Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick."
9619,32,2,10,"James: Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man."
9620,32,2,10,Barney: What? No way.
9621,32,2,10,"James: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind."
9622,32,2,10,"James leaves Barney. Three girls come in, one of them with a bridal veil."
9623,32,2,10,"Woman: Two beers, one shot."
9624,32,2,10,"Barney: Oh, it's a freaking epidemic."
9625,32,2,10,"Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin are at the apartment."
9626,32,2,10,"Lily: Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?"
9627,32,2,10,Marshall: Yes.
9628,32,2,10,"Barney: Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures."
9629,32,2,10,Ted: I don't get manicures.
9630,32,2,10,"Barney: Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed."
9631,32,2,10,Lily: You get your chest waxed?
9632,32,2,10,"Barney: You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened."
9633,32,2,10,"Marshall: Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this."
9634,32,2,10,"Barney: No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom."
9635,32,2,10,Marshall: Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.
9636,32,2,10,Barney: Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.
9637,32,2,10,"Ted: Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him."
9638,32,2,10,"Barney: You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make."
9639,32,2,10,"Barney and james arrive at a gay bar with Marshall, lily, Ted and Robin."
9640,32,2,10,James: Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?
9641,32,2,10,"Barney: What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment."
9642,32,2,10,"Marshall: Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious."
9643,32,2,10,Man: Hey. You work out?
9644,32,2,10,Marshall: I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself.
9645,32,2,10,"Man: Well, I try. So you want to dance?"
9646,32,2,10,"Marshall: You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée."
9647,32,2,10,"Man: I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I..."
9648,32,2,10,"Marshall: No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers."
9649,32,2,10,"Lily: No, it isn't."
9650,32,2,10,Man: Whatever. How 'bout you?
9651,32,2,10,"Ted: Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body."
9652,32,2,10,"Marshall: You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity."
9653,32,2,10,"Man: Hey, I really like your sweater."
9654,32,2,10,"Robin: Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything."
9655,32,2,10,"Man: My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?"
9656,32,2,10,Robin: I love this place! Let's dance!
9657,32,2,10,Lily:  - And not be groped!
9658,32,2,10,Robin: - Whoo! Thank you.
9659,32,2,10,Man(looking at Ted)- Damn.
9660,32,2,10,Ted: - Thank you!
9661,32,2,10,Marshall: - We're hot.
9662,32,2,10,Ted: - Totally.
9663,32,2,10,"James:  And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!"
9664,32,2,10,Barney: Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.
9665,32,2,10,"James: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom."
9666,32,2,10,"Barney: And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?"
9667,32,2,10,"James: Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player."
9668,32,2,10,"Barney: Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?"
9669,32,2,10,James: Please.
9670,32,2,10,"Barney: He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!"
9671,32,2,10,Marshall: I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.
9672,32,2,10,"Ted: Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone."
9673,32,2,10,"Man: Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!"
9674,32,2,10,"Marshall: Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so..."
9675,32,2,10,"Man: Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?"
9676,32,2,10,"Ted: God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?"
9677,32,2,10,"Robin: How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?"
9678,32,2,10,"Marshall: That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello,"
9679,32,2,10,my eyes are up here.
9680,32,2,10,Ted: And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!
9681,32,2,10,Lily: Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?
9682,32,2,10,"Robin: Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar."
9683,32,2,10,"Barney: James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah."
9684,32,2,10,James: Barney.
9685,32,2,10,"Barney: So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood..."
9686,32,2,10,"James: Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married."
9687,32,2,10,Charles: Wow.- Best of luck to you both.
9688,32,2,10,James: - Thank you.
9689,32,2,10,Charles: My number's in here. I'm very discreet.
9690,32,2,10,"James: Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life..."
9691,32,2,10,"Barney: Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?"
9692,32,2,10,James: To get laid.
9693,32,2,10,"Barney: To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!"
9694,32,2,10,"James: - Yes, I do."
9695,32,2,10,Barney: - Why?!
9696,32,2,10,James: Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.
9697,32,2,10,Barney: What? There's gonna be a baby?
9698,32,2,10,James: Yes. We're adopting.
9699,32,2,10,"Barney: Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?"
9700,32,2,10,James: For the rest of your life.
9701,32,2,10,"Ted (voix off) And that's how Barney became Uncle Barney. A year later, at James's wedding, Barney could not have been more proud."
9702,32,2,10,At James's wedding
9703,32,2,10,Barney: To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.
9704,32,2,10,Tous: - Cheers.
9705,32,2,10,Barney: Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to
9706,32,2,10,hear about that.
9707,32,2,10,Lily: It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.
9708,32,2,10,Marshall: Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?
9709,32,2,10,"Ted: Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer."
9710,32,2,10,"Robin: Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all."
9711,32,2,10,"Marshall: All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home."
9712,32,2,10,"Lily: Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat."
9713,32,2,10,"Barney: Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic."
9714,32,2,10,Ted and Robin get up to dance.
9715,32,2,10,Barney: - May I?
9716,32,2,10,James: - Yeah.
9717,32,2,10,James stands un and leaves the baby with Barney.
9718,32,2,10,"Barney: Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?"
9719,32,2,10,Barney talks with a woman.
9720,32,2,10,Rosa: I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?
9721,32,2,10,"Barney: Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You..."
9722,33,2,11,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family."
9723,33,2,11,Lily is decorating the apartment while Marshall studies
9724,33,2,11,"Marshall: Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason."
9725,33,2,11,"Ted: Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself."
9726,33,2,11,"Marshall: No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?"
9727,33,2,11,Lily: Yes.
9728,33,2,11,"Marshall: Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!"
9729,33,2,11,"Lily: Hey, look. Our old answering machine."
9730,33,2,11,"Ted: Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back."
9731,33,2,11,"Lily: Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here."
9732,33,2,11,"Ted's father: Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this"
9733,33,2,11,"weekend with my friend Clint, so if I don't hear from you beforehand, I'll talk to you next week."
9734,33,2,11,"Ted: Yes, same Clint."
9735,33,2,11,"Ted (voix dans le répondeur): Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch."
9736,33,2,11,"Ted (voix off): But I didn't say ""Grinch."" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word."
9737,33,2,11,"Ted: Oh, fudge."
9738,33,2,11,Ted (voix off): But I didn't say fudge.
9739,33,2,11,Lily: I'm... a what?
9740,33,2,11,"Ted: I-- That was Barney, that was Barney."
9741,33,2,11,"Lily: That was you, Ted."
9742,33,2,11,Ted: That was Marshall.
9743,33,2,11,Lily: Marshall left a message for Marshall?
9744,33,2,11,"Ted: You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said..."
9745,33,2,11,Lily: Why would you call me that?
9746,33,2,11,Ted (voix off): It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...
9747,33,2,11,Marshall is eating on the couch while Ted reads the newspaper.
9748,33,2,11,Marshall: She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.
9749,33,2,11,Ted: Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.
9750,33,2,11,Marshall: There's only one of her?
9751,33,2,11,Ted: Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?
9752,33,2,11,Marshall: Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.
9753,33,2,11,Ted: There you go.
9754,33,2,11,"Ted (voix off): And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire."
9755,33,2,11,"Flashback. Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar."
9756,33,2,11,"Marshall: Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything."
9757,33,2,11,"Barney: She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut."
9758,33,2,11,"Ted: Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?"
9759,33,2,11,"Barney: And her art? ""I'm Lily, I'm an artist."" She doesn't even own a beret."
9760,33,2,11,"Marshall: Yeah, and if she's such a great ""artist,"" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?"
9761,33,2,11,Ted: Yeah!
9762,33,2,11,Marshall: Another round!
9763,33,2,11,End of flashback. Back at the apartment.
9764,33,2,11,Ted: I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.
9765,33,2,11,Lily: The best friend's job is to call me that word?
9766,33,2,11,Ted: Yeah.
9767,33,2,11,"Barney, Robin and &auml;Ted are at the bar."
9768,33,2,11,"Robin: Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy."
9769,33,2,11,"Ted: Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word."
9770,33,2,11,Barney: Then why don't you say it now?
9771,33,2,11,Ted: Grinch. You timed that didn't you?
9772,33,2,11,Barney: Perfectly.
9773,33,2,11,"Robin: Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?"
9774,33,2,11,"Ted: Oh, yeah. ""I'm sorry"" were the first words out of my mouth."
9775,33,2,11,Flashback. Lily and Ted at the apartment.
9776,33,2,11,"Ted: I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces."
9777,33,2,11,Lily: Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?
9778,33,2,11,Ted: No!
9779,33,2,11,Lily: Why not?
9780,33,2,11,"Ted: Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch."
9781,33,2,11,"Lily: Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby."
9782,33,2,11,End of flashback. Back to the bar.
9783,33,2,11,Barney: Ted Vivian Mosby!
9784,33,2,11,Ted: That's not my middle name.
9785,33,2,11,Barney: Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
9786,33,2,11,Ted: Like you've never said that word.
9787,33,2,11,Barney: I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes)
9788,33,2,11,Ted: Are you sick?
9789,33,2,11,Barney: Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?
9790,33,2,11,"Ted: No, I meant do you have a cold?"
9791,33,2,11,"Barney: I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year."
9792,33,2,11,Ted: I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.
9793,33,2,11,"Robin: Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays."
9794,33,2,11,Barney talks to a girl.
9795,33,2,11,"Barney: I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)"
9796,33,2,11,"Woman: Oh! Oh, God!"
9797,33,2,11,"Barney: Uh... ""Bless you"" would have been nice."
9798,33,2,11,Robin walks Barney home. On the Hallway.
9799,33,2,11,Robin: You're sick.
9800,33,2,11,Barney: I'm not sick.
9801,33,2,11,Robin: You're sick.
9802,33,2,11,Barney: You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?
9803,33,2,11,Barney cough so strongly that he fells.
9804,33,2,11,"Ted: Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy."
9805,33,2,11,Robin: You sure this is gonna work?
9806,33,2,11,"Ted: Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?"
9807,33,2,11,Robin: Totally. Plus free mug.
9808,33,2,11,"Ted (voix off): Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little."
9809,33,2,11,Ted: She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!
9810,33,2,11,"Ted (voix off): That time I did say ""Grinch."""
9811,33,2,11,"Ted: All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial."
9812,33,2,11,"Robin: Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?"
9813,33,2,11,"Barney: Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive ""no cigars in the apartment rule."" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. (he sneezes on his hand). High five."
9814,33,2,11,Robin: Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.
9815,33,2,11,"Barney: Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... (Barney falls asleep)"
9816,33,2,11,Ted: Lily!
9817,33,2,11,"Lily: Merry Christmas, assface."
9818,33,2,11,"Ted: Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?"
9819,33,2,11,Lily: At my apartment.
9820,33,2,11,Ted: You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?
9821,33,2,11,"Lily: Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents."
9822,33,2,11,"Ted: Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner."
9823,33,2,11,Lily: Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.
9824,33,2,11,"Ted: Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we..."
9825,33,2,11,Ted to Robin: She hung up.
9826,33,2,11,Robin: She's just mad. She'll cool down.
9827,33,2,11,The phone rings
9828,33,2,11,Ted: Lily...
9829,33,2,11,Lily: Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!
9830,33,2,11,Ted: Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.
9831,33,2,11,Robin: Where are you going?
9832,33,2,11,"Ted: Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx."
9833,33,2,11,Ted goes out slamming the door which wakes up Barney)
9834,33,2,11,Barney:...dary.
9835,33,2,11,Ted's on the street when his phone rings.
9836,33,2,11,"Ted: Hey, dude, how's the paper going?"
9837,33,2,11,"Marshall: Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?"
9838,33,2,11,Ted: Oh... so magical.
9839,33,2,11,"Marshall: When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?"
9840,33,2,11,"Ted: Sure does. Look, I gotta go."
9841,33,2,11,"Marshall: Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!"
9842,33,2,11,"Ted: Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?"
9843,33,2,11,"Marshall: Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?"
9844,33,2,11,"Ted: Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means ""More Christ"" to our Spanish friends."
9845,33,2,11,"Marshall: Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait."
9846,33,2,11,Ted: Right. I gotta go.
9847,33,2,11,"Marshall: Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious?"
9848,33,2,11,
9849,33,2,11,Robin is at the apartment with a fire extinguisher
9850,33,2,11,"Ted: You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call."
9851,33,2,11,"Marshall: Well, tell Lily I love her."
9852,33,2,11,Ted:  Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello?
9853,33,2,11,His mother: Ted Evelyn Mosby!
9854,33,2,11,"Ted: Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas."
9855,33,2,11,His mother: I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?
9856,33,2,11,"Ted: Oh, God, she called you?"
9857,33,2,11,His mother: Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?
9858,33,2,11,"Ted: No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?"
9859,33,2,11,"Clint: Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?"
9860,33,2,11,"Ted: Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to..."
9861,33,2,11,"Clint: Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual..."
9862,33,2,11,Ted hangs up and takes the subway.
9863,33,2,11,Barney is in bed and Robin brings hm food.
9864,33,2,11,"Barney: This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous."
9865,33,2,11,Robin: You just look like a regular guy.
9866,33,2,11,Barney: Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.
9867,33,2,11,Robin: And isn't it more comfy?
9868,33,2,11,Barney: Yes.
9869,33,2,11,"Robin: Come on, you need eat something."
9870,33,2,11,Barney: Too weak... to hold... bowl.
9871,33,2,11,"Robin: Fine, I'll feed you."
9872,33,2,11,Barney: Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.
9873,33,2,11,"Robin: No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick."
9874,33,2,11,Barney: But my throat hurts.
9875,33,2,11,Robin: No!
9876,33,2,11,Barney: I hate you!
9877,33,2,11,Robin stands up
9878,33,2,11,Barney: Don't leave me.
9879,33,2,11,Lily is at her apartment when someone knocks on the door.
9880,33,2,11,Lily: Who is this?
9881,33,2,11,Ted: Pizza delivery.
9882,33,2,11,"Lily: Hey, you tricked me."
9883,33,2,11,Ted: You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?
9884,33,2,11,"Lily: No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza."
9885,33,2,11,"Ted: Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?"
9886,33,2,11,"Lily: No, I'm not spending Christmas with you."
9887,33,2,11,"Ted: Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry."
9888,33,2,11,"Lily: Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me."
9889,33,2,11,Ted: I'm not mad at you.
9890,33,2,11,"Lily: Yes, you are."
9891,33,2,11,"Ted: I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just..."
9892,33,2,11,Lily: I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?
9893,33,2,11,"Ted: Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!"
9894,33,2,11,"Lily: Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch."
9895,33,2,11,Ted: You were a Grinch!
9896,33,2,11,Lily: How can you...
9897,33,2,11,"Ted: Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch."
9898,33,2,11,The light goes out
9899,33,2,11,"Lily: Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs."
9900,33,2,11,"Ted: Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I..."
9901,33,2,11,Voice: You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!
9902,33,2,11,"Lily: That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark."
9903,33,2,11,Ted: Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.
9904,33,2,11,Ted walks out lily's apartment.
9905,33,2,11,"Robin (on the phone): You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry."
9906,33,2,11,"Ted: Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us."
9907,33,2,11,"Robin: Well, do you want me to go with you?"
9908,33,2,11,Ted: Was that a sincere offer?
9909,33,2,11,Robin: First tell me your answer.
9910,33,2,11,"Ted: Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?"
9911,33,2,11,"Robin: You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine."
9912,33,2,11,Ted: You're gonna be a great mom.
9913,33,2,11,Marshall walks into the apartment with a box.
9914,33,2,11,"Marshall: Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities."
9915,33,2,11,Lily: Merry Christmas! What's in the box?
9916,33,2,11,Marshall: Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.
9917,33,2,11,Lily: I thought you were writing a paper.
9918,33,2,11,"Marshall: Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas..."
9919,33,2,11,Flashback. Marshall is at the post office
9920,33,2,11,"Marshall: It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here."
9921,33,2,11,"Women: Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie."
9922,33,2,11,"Marshall: What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today."
9923,33,2,11,"Women: Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it..."
9924,33,2,11,Marshall runs after the truck
9925,33,2,11,"Marshall: Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?"
9926,33,2,11,Truck driver: Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.
9927,33,2,11,Marshall gets in the truck
9928,33,2,11,Truck driver: My bad.
9929,33,2,11,"Marshall: I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas."
9930,33,2,11,Truck driver: No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.
9931,33,2,11,"Marshall: Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?"
9932,33,2,11,"Truck driver: Sadly, no."
9933,33,2,11,Marshall helps the truck driver deliver the gifts. End of flashback. Back at the apartment
9934,33,2,11,"Marshall: We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby."
9935,33,2,11,"Lily: Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?"
9936,33,2,11,Flashback. A month earlier Marshall and Ted are in the bar.
9937,33,2,11,Marshall: It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.
9938,33,2,11,"Ted: Wow, that's a great gift."
9939,33,2,11,Marshall: Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.
9940,33,2,11,"Ted: Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago..."
9941,33,2,11,Flashback. Ted and Lily are in marshall and Ted's college room.
9942,33,2,11,"Lily: When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles."
9943,33,2,11,Ted: Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.
9944,33,2,11,Marshall walks in
9945,33,2,11,Ted: Dude... how was the concert?
9946,33,2,11,Marshall: I couldn't find the outside.
9947,33,2,11,End of flashback. Back to the apartment with Lily and Marshall.
9948,33,2,11,Lily: I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.
9949,33,2,11,"Marshall: Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?"
9950,33,2,11,Lily: Staten Island.
9951,33,2,11,Marshall: Why?
9952,33,2,11,Staton island. Ted is in the livingroom with kids.
9953,33,2,11,"Ted: Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents."
9954,33,2,11,A kid: Like the gift of God's love?
9955,33,2,11,"Ted: No, dude, real presents."
9956,33,2,11,Kid: Uncle Ted got us presents!
9957,33,2,11,"Stacy: That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity."
9958,33,2,11,Charity: Yay!
9959,33,2,11,"Stacy: Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?"
9960,33,2,11,"Ted: Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say."
9961,33,2,11,Charity: Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.
9962,33,2,11,"Ted: That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in."
9963,33,2,11,"Charity: Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen."
9964,33,2,11,Ted opens the door and sees everybody. Lily's holding a beer.
9965,33,2,11,"Stacy: Who is it, Ted?"
9966,33,2,11,"Ted: Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow."
9967,33,2,11,# Silent night. Holy night... #
9968,33,2,11,"Lily: I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted."
9969,33,2,11,Ted: I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.
9970,33,2,11,Lily: Are you coming home?
9971,33,2,11,"Ted: Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology."
9972,33,2,11,"Lily: Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?"
9973,33,2,11,Ted: Yes
9974,33,2,11,Lily: Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?
9975,33,2,11,"Ted: Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again."
9976,33,2,11,Lily: That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.
9977,33,2,11,Kid(in the house) What's a Grinch?
9978,33,2,11,Ted: Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.
9979,33,2,11,"Kid: Mom, what's a Grinch?"
9980,33,2,11,Stacy spits out the water she had in the mouth.
9981,33,2,11,"Both kids: Grinch, Grinch, Grinch..."
9982,33,2,11,"Ted ( to the family): Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves (to his friends) Run, run."
9983,33,2,11,In the apartment Mashall is eating the cookies.
9984,34,2,12,"Ted (V.O.): Kids, you remember my first day with Robin."
9985,34,2,12,Flashaback. Ted and Robin are at Robin's apartment.
9986,34,2,12,Ted: I think I'm in love with you.
9987,34,2,12,Robin: What?!
9988,34,2,12,End of flashback.
9989,34,2,12,"Ted (voix off): Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say ""I love you."" Robin went through the usual stages."
9990,34,2,12,"Flashback. Ted, Robin and Barney are at the apartment."
9991,34,2,12,Robin: Spider! Spider!
9992,34,2,12,Barney: I left something in the hallway.
9993,34,2,12,Ted: Where?
9994,34,2,12,Robin: Right there.
9995,34,2,12,Ted: Got it.
9996,34,2,12,Ted kisses Robin. Barney comes back to the apartment.
9997,34,2,12,Ted (voix off): First there's the moment when you think you think it.
9998,34,2,12,"Ted: Whoa, still alive."
9999,34,2,12,Barney leaves the apartment.
10000,34,2,12,Ted (voix off): There's the moment you think you know it.
10001,34,2,12,Robin is sick and in bed:
10002,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick."
10003,34,2,12,Ted still kisses her. Two days later he's the one who's sick.
10004,34,2,12,Ted: Totally worth it.
10005,34,2,12,"Ted (voix off): There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it."
10006,34,2,12,"Ted: All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?"
10007,34,2,12,Robin: Good night.
10008,34,2,12,Ted: Good night.
10009,34,2,12,"Robin: Wait, Ted?"
10010,34,2,12,Ted: Yeah?
10011,34,2,12,Robin: Good night.
10012,34,2,12,"The next morning, Ted walks into Robin's apartment. Robin's on the phone."
10013,34,2,12,"Robin: Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday."
10014,34,2,12,Ted: That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.
10015,34,2,12,Robin: Really? You'd do that?
10016,34,2,12,Ted: Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.
10017,34,2,12,"Ted (voix off): And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer."
10018,34,2,12,Flashback. At Ted's apartment.
10019,34,2,12,Robin: Ted.
10020,34,2,12,Ted: Yeah?
10021,34,2,12,Robin: Falafel.
10022,34,2,12,Credits. Robin and lily are at the airport.
10023,34,2,12,Lily: Falafel?
10024,34,2,12,Robin: Falafel.
10025,34,2,12,"Lily: Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said ""falafel""?"
10026,34,2,12,Robin: I totally choked.
10027,34,2,12,Lily: I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?
10028,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me."
10029,34,2,12,"Lily: Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No."
10030,34,2,12,"Robin: Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit."
10031,34,2,12,Lily: Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.
10032,34,2,12,The whole gang is at the bar
10033,34,2,12,"Barney: Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway."
10034,34,2,12,"Marshall: Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus."
10035,34,2,12,"Barney: No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower."
10036,34,2,12,"Robin: So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that."
10037,34,2,12,"Barney: The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars."
10038,34,2,12,Ted: What?
10039,34,2,12,"Barney: Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, ""Are we there yet?"""
10040,34,2,12,End of flashback. Back with Robin and Lily.
10041,34,2,12,"Robin: So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit."
10042,34,2,12,"Lily: Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall."
10043,34,2,12,Robin: It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.
10044,34,2,12,"Lily: Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing."
10045,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, here comes Katie."
10046,34,2,12,"Lily: Aw, your sister's so cute."
10047,34,2,12,"Robin: Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack."
10048,34,2,12,Her sister is kissing a boy.
10049,34,2,12,"Lily: Hello, Kitty."
10050,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, no. No. No. No."
10051,34,2,12,"Katie: Hey, Robin. How are you?"
10052,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?"
10053,34,2,12,"Katie: Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle."
10054,34,2,12,Kyle: Looks like hotness runs in the family.
10055,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?"
10056,34,2,12,Katie: Two whole months.
10057,34,2,12,Kyle: Yeah.
10058,34,2,12,"Katie: He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?"
10059,34,2,12,"Kyle: My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so..."
10060,34,2,12,Robin: That's cool. This is my friend Lily.
10061,34,2,12,Kyle: Hot.
10062,34,2,12,"Robin: You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled."
10063,34,2,12,"Katie: Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight."
10064,34,2,12,"Robin: Uh, no, you're not."
10065,34,2,12,"Katie: Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean."
10066,34,2,12,Robin: What? Oh. Oh...
10067,34,2,12,The whole gang is at the bar.
10068,34,2,12,Robin : I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.
10069,34,2,12,Marshall: Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.
10070,34,2,12,"Ted: Yeah, I don't have any of those."
10071,34,2,12,Barney: Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.
10072,34,2,12,Robin: Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.
10073,34,2,12,Lily: It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.
10074,34,2,12,Robin: That's why I need your help.
10075,34,2,12,They're all at the Empire State Building.
10076,34,2,12,"Ted (voix off): Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building."
10077,34,2,12,Ted: You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun
10078,34,2,12,"fact number one: When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them."
10079,34,2,12,"Robin: You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special."
10080,34,2,12,"Katie: Oh, here we go."
10081,34,2,12,Lily: Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.
10082,34,2,12,"Marshall: Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot."
10083,34,2,12,Katie: You told them?
10084,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?"
10085,34,2,12,All: Totally. You should wait.
10086,34,2,12,Barney: s*x is fun.
10087,34,2,12,Robin: See?
10088,34,2,12,Katie: You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.
10089,34,2,12,"Robin: Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room."
10090,34,2,12,"Barney: I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary."
10091,34,2,12,"Katie: Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even..."
10092,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la."
10093,34,2,12,Marshall: Even Kyle gets to do that.
10094,34,2,12,Katie: You have no right to tell me not to do it.
10095,34,2,12,"Robin: But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted."
10096,34,2,12,"Katie: Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove."
10097,34,2,12,"Robin: You smoke now, too?"
10098,34,2,12,"Lily: Oh, remember cloves?"
10099,34,2,12,Marshall: No!
10100,34,2,12,"Robin: No ""Aw, remember cloves?"" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x."
10101,34,2,12,"Ted: Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17."
10102,34,2,12,Marshall: We were 18.
10103,34,2,12,Ted: Barney was probably 12.
10104,34,2,12,"Barney: Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?"
10105,34,2,12,Ted: 17.
10106,34,2,12,"Barney: Dude, me, too."
10107,34,2,12,"Lily: Barney, you okay?"
10108,34,2,12,"Barney: Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm..."
10109,34,2,12,Marshall: What camp?
10110,34,2,12,Barney: This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.
10111,34,2,12,Robin: What did you teach?
10112,34,2,12,"Barney: Uh, dance."
10113,34,2,12,Ted: Dance?
10114,34,2,12,"Barney: Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby."
10115,34,2,12,Flashback. Where Barney work that summer.
10116,34,2,12,Barney: Sylvia
10117,34,2,12,"Sylvia: Yes, Mickey?"
10118,34,2,12,Barney: How you call your loverboy?
10119,34,2,12,"Sylvia: Come here, loverboy"
10120,34,2,12,Barney: And if he doesn't answer
10121,34,2,12,"Sylvia: Oh, loverboy"
10122,34,2,12,Barney: And if he still doesn't answer?
10123,34,2,12,"Sylvia: I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby"
10124,34,2,12,End of flashback. Back to the Empire State Building.
10125,34,2,12,Lily: That's Dirty Dancing.
10126,34,2,12,Ted: It was on last night.
10127,34,2,12,"Marshall: No, it was two nights ago. ""She's Like the Wind"" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!"
10128,34,2,12,Lily: Do you remember our first time?
10129,34,2,12,Marshall: Yeah. It was back in college.
10130,34,2,12,Flashback. 1996. In Marshall and Ted's college room. Marshall and lily are kissing.
10131,34,2,12,"Lily: Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right."
10132,34,2,12,Marshall: Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.
10133,34,2,12,"Lily: Yeah, New Year's Eve."
10134,34,2,12,Marshall: Okay.
10135,34,2,12,"Lily: Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music."
10136,34,2,12,Marshall: That's not a good idea.
10137,34,2,12,Lily: Why not?
10138,34,2,12,Marshall: Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.
10139,34,2,12,"Lily: Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback."
10140,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, that's adorable."
10141,34,2,12,"Ted: Yeah, tell her what happened next."
10142,34,2,12,Back to Marshall and lily's flashback.
10143,34,2,12,Marshall: That was amazing.
10144,34,2,12,Lily: Yeah. Want to do it again?
10145,34,2,12,Ted (on the bed of the top): Please don't. End of flashback.
10146,34,2,12,Marshall: We said we were sorry.
10147,34,2,12,"Ted: Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?"
10148,34,2,12,"Marshall: You know what, I loaned you my Walkman."
10149,34,2,12,"Lily: The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be."
10150,34,2,12,"Robin: Well, mine was terrible."
10151,34,2,12,"Lily: Wait, I've never heard your story."
10152,34,2,12,"Robin: Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian."
10153,34,2,12,Flashback. Robin's in bed with Brian.
10154,34,2,12,Brian: Ready?
10155,34,2,12,Robin: Yeah.
10156,34,2,12,Brian: This feels so right.
10157,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, I know."
10158,34,2,12,"Brian: Oh, Robin."
10159,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, Brian."
10160,34,2,12,"Brian: Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback."
10161,34,2,12,Lily: I'm so sorry.
10162,34,2,12,"Robin: Eh, I should've known. There were signs."
10163,34,2,12,Back to Robin's flashback.
10164,34,2,12,"Brian: Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed."
10165,34,2,12,"Robin: What?! Oh, my God!"
10166,34,2,12,End of flashback.
10167,34,2,12,"Robin: You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts."
10168,34,2,12,Lily: What do you mean just barely?
10169,34,2,12,"Robin: Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end."
10170,34,2,12,Lily:  Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.
10171,34,2,12,"Robin: Yes, it does."
10172,34,2,12,"Lily: No, it doesn't."
10173,34,2,12,"Marshall: Yes, it does."
10174,34,2,12,"Lily: No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story."
10175,34,2,12,"Barney: Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?"
10176,34,2,12,"Marshall: No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?"
10177,34,2,12,Barney: Who's Scooter?
10178,34,2,12,"Lily: My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with."
10179,34,2,12,"Marshall: I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other."""
10180,34,2,12,"Barney: No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) ""Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other."""
10181,34,2,12,"Marshall: But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it."
10182,34,2,12,Katie: Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.
10183,34,2,12,Ted: It's not stupid.
10184,34,2,12,Katie: I'm going to see Kyle.
10185,34,2,12,"Robin: Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special."
10186,34,2,12,"Katie: Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys."
10187,34,2,12,Robin: It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.
10188,34,2,12,Katie: I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.
10189,34,2,12,Robin: I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.
10190,34,2,12,"Katie: Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?"
10191,34,2,12,"Robin: I, um..."
10192,34,2,12,"Ted: Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?"
10193,34,2,12,Robin: Just let me explain.
10194,34,2,12,Ted: You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.
10195,34,2,12,"Robin: Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... ""hm hm hm"" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get..."
10196,34,2,12,"Ted: Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it."
10197,34,2,12,"Robin: It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon."
10198,34,2,12,"Ted: What, you mean like I did?"
10199,34,2,12,"Robin: No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird."
10200,34,2,12,Ted: Weird... or courageous?
10201,34,2,12,"Robin: Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?"
10202,34,2,12,"Ted: Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight."
10203,34,2,12,"Robin: No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut."
10204,34,2,12,"Ted: Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back."
10205,34,2,12,Robin: You... What?
10206,34,2,12,"Ted: I take my ""I love you"" back."
10207,34,2,12,Robin: You can't take it back.
10208,34,2,12,"Ted: Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you."
10209,34,2,12,"Man: Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)"
10210,34,2,12,"Lily: Marshall, why is this such a big deal?"
10211,34,2,12,"Marshall: Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: ""One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did..."
10212,34,2,12,"Lily: Okay, Marshall, I get it."
10213,34,2,12,Marshall: It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.
10214,34,2,12,"Lily: No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count."
10215,34,2,12,"Marshall: Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?"
10216,34,2,12,"Man (the same that talked to Ted) Um, we're in it right now."
10217,34,2,12,"Marshall: Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man."
10218,34,2,12,Man: You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!
10219,34,2,12,"Robin: Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made."
10220,34,2,12,"Katie: Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay."
10221,34,2,12,Robin: That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.
10222,34,2,12,"Ted (V.O.) : But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage."
10223,34,2,12,His kids: Dad!
10224,34,2,12,"The girl: Come on, what really happened?"
10225,34,2,12,"Ted (V.O.): All right, here's what really happened."
10226,34,2,12,
10227,34,2,12,Ted is sitting on the couch at the apartment when Robin comes in.
10228,34,2,12,Robin: Hey.
10229,34,2,12,Ted: Hey.
10230,34,2,12,Robin: She didn't do it.
10231,34,2,12,"Ted: Hey, that's great! You got through to her."
10232,34,2,12,"Robin: No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her."
10233,34,2,12,Flashback. Ted meets Katie et the Empire State Building.
10234,34,2,12,"Ted: Hey, Katie."
10235,34,2,12,Katie: Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?
10236,34,2,12,"Ted: No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?"
10237,34,2,12,"Katie: I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out."
10238,34,2,12,"Ted: That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time."
10239,34,2,12,"Katie: Oh, really?"
10240,34,2,12,"Ted: Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly."
10241,34,2,12,Flashback. Ted is on the bed with molly.
10242,34,2,12,"Molly: I love you, Ted."
10243,34,2,12,"Ted: Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't."
10244,34,2,12,Molly: That was amazing.
10245,34,2,12,"Ted: Look, I got to go."
10246,34,2,12,Molly: Where are you going?
10247,34,2,12,Ted: My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.
10248,34,2,12,"Molly: Well, will you call me?"
10249,34,2,12,"Ted: Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly?"
10250,34,2,12,Molly: Yeah?
10251,34,2,12,Ted: Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.(Voix off) But I didn't.
10252,34,2,12,End of flashback. Back to Katie and Ted.
10253,34,2,12,"Ted: And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones."
10254,34,2,12,Flashback. Katie's at Robin apartment.
10255,34,2,12,Katie: So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.
10256,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?"
10257,34,2,12,Katie: Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.
10258,34,2,12,Robin: Don't tell Mom.
10259,34,2,12,End of flashbacks. Back to robin and Ted.
10260,34,2,12,Robin: Thanks for doing that.
10261,34,2,12,Ted: You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.
10262,34,2,12,"Robin: But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you."
10263,34,2,12,"Ted: Yeah, well..."
10264,34,2,12,Flashback. Ted and molly are on the bed.
10265,34,2,12,"Ted: I love you, Molly."
10266,34,2,12,"Molly: Oh, I love you, too, Ted."
10267,34,2,12,Ted: Wow. That was amazing.
10268,34,2,12,"Molly:  Look, I got to go."
10269,34,2,12,Ted: Wh-Where are you going?
10270,34,2,12,"Molly: Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome."
10271,34,2,12,Ted: Will you call me?
10272,34,2,12,"Molly: Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?"
10273,34,2,12,Ted: Yeah?
10274,34,2,12,Molly: Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.
10275,34,2,12,End of flashback.
10276,34,2,12,Ted: But she didn't.
10277,34,2,12,"Robin: Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you."
10278,34,2,12,"Ted: I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity."
10279,34,2,12,Robin: Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.
10280,34,2,12,Ted (voix off): Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.
10281,34,2,12,Ted: I am so glad we're finally doing this.
10282,34,2,12,Barney: What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.
10283,34,2,12,"Marshall: Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap."
10284,34,2,12,"Lily: Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story."
10285,34,2,12,"Marshall: Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other."
10286,34,2,12,Lily: We've only had s*x with each other.
10287,34,2,12,Barney: They've only had s*x with each other.
10288,34,2,12,"Ted: Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!"
10289,34,2,12,They're at the bar.
10290,34,2,12,"Ted: So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?"
10291,34,2,12,"Marshall: Well, we're usually busy... drinking."
10292,34,2,12,"Lily: Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story."
10293,34,2,12,"Marshall: That's right, I almost forgot."
10294,34,2,12,"Barney: Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout..."
10295,34,2,12,Marshall: Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
10296,34,2,12,"Barney: I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl..."
10297,34,2,12,Ted: Risky Business.
10298,34,2,12,Barney: I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...
10299,34,2,12,"Ted: That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it."
10300,34,2,12,"Barney: All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me ""Barry"" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?"
10301,34,2,12,Marshall: Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.
10302,34,2,12,Barney: Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.
10303,34,2,12,Ted: Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
10304,35,2,13,"Flashback. In 1982, Ted is building a tower with legos."
10305,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper."
10306,35,2,13,Boy: That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.)
10307,35,2,13,End of flashback
10308,35,2,13,Ted (voix off): There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.
10309,35,2,13,Ted at work.
10310,35,2,13,"Ted: Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns."
10311,35,2,13,Mr. Druthers: That's stupid. (he destroys his model)
10312,35,2,13,Credits.
10313,35,2,13,Ted: I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.
10314,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?"
10315,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it."
10316,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Stairs?
10317,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss."
10318,35,2,13,Flashback. Ted's in the break room with two co-workers.
10319,35,2,13,Ted: Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.
10320,35,2,13,"Co-worker: Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it."
10321,35,2,13,Ted (voix off): But suddenly I was a different guy.
10322,35,2,13,Ted's in the break room with two co-workers.
10323,35,2,13,"Ted: Hey, guys. What's so funny?"
10324,35,2,13,Co-worker: Nothing. Um... nice shirt.
10325,35,2,13,Ted: Thanks.
10326,35,2,13,Ted (voix off): The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.
10327,35,2,13,Ted and Robin are on the bed. Robin is sleeping.
10328,35,2,13,"Ted: Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea."
10329,35,2,13,"Robin: Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up."
10330,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): Before, I used to be this guy."
10331,35,2,13,"Ted: Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick."
10332,35,2,13,Ted (voix off): But now...I was this guy.
10333,35,2,13,"Ted: Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... ""Foo Fighters."" Get back to work."
10334,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): But still, the worst part was Druthers."
10335,35,2,13,End of flashback. Back to work.
10336,35,2,13,"Ted: Well, I was thinking..."
10337,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss."
10338,35,2,13,The whole gang's at the bar.
10339,35,2,13,"Robin: Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking."
10340,35,2,13,Ted: Why would you say that?
10341,35,2,13,"Robin: Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that."
10342,35,2,13,Barney: I have found that to be true.
10343,35,2,13,Marshall: It's a blessing and a curse really.
10344,35,2,13,"Lily: Ted, you can't let him treat you like that."
10345,35,2,13,"Marshall: Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?"
10346,35,2,13,Ted: Tony.
10347,35,2,13,Robin: Angela.
10348,35,2,13,Barney: Mona.
10349,35,2,13,Robin: Mona?
10350,35,2,13,Barney: Watch it more closely. Rock your world.
10351,35,2,13,"Robin: So, what are you gonna do?"
10352,35,2,13,"Ted: Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner."
10353,35,2,13,Flashback. Ted is with the Managing Partner.
10354,35,2,13,MP: Fire him.
10355,35,2,13,"Ted: Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project."
10356,35,2,13,"MP: Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them."
10357,35,2,13,"Ted: Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work."
10358,35,2,13,"MP: Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby."
10359,35,2,13,End of flashback. Back at Ted's apartment.
10360,35,2,13,Barney: You mind if I charge my phone?
10361,35,2,13,Ted: Knock yourself out.
10362,35,2,13,"Robin: Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?"
10363,35,2,13,Flasback Robin's work.
10364,35,2,13,"Robin: Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims."
10365,35,2,13,End of flashback
10366,35,2,13,Ted: You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.
10367,35,2,13,"Barney: Oh, my God! (barney's holding a painting)"
10368,35,2,13,Ted: What?
10369,35,2,13,Barney: Do you know about this?
10370,35,2,13,Ted: No.
10371,35,2,13,Robin: What is that?
10372,35,2,13,"Barney: Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall."
10373,35,2,13,"Ted: Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared."
10374,35,2,13,"Barney: I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time."
10375,35,2,13,"Robin: Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it."
10376,35,2,13,"Barney: Oh, come on, Robin."
10377,35,2,13,"Robin: No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun."
10378,35,2,13,Barney: I know! We're gonna have so much fun!
10379,35,2,13,At Ted's work.
10380,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?"
10381,35,2,13,"Ted: Uh, yeah, like four hours ago."
10382,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building."
10383,35,2,13,"Ted: This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office."
10384,35,2,13,The others employees come with a cake and singing.
10385,35,2,13,Employees: Happy birthday to you.
10386,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Oh, you had me. You so had me."
10387,35,2,13,In Ted's apartment.
10388,35,2,13,"Robin: So, you didn't fire him?"
10389,35,2,13,"Ted: I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised."
10390,35,2,13,"Barney: Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools."
10391,35,2,13,"Marshall: Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture."
10392,35,2,13,"Robin: And, uh... I... got you a rose."
10393,35,2,13,Marshall: Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.
10394,35,2,13,"Barney: Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart."
10395,35,2,13,"Robin: Oh, wow, a new dart."
10396,35,2,13,"Ted: Hey, that new dart is great."
10397,35,2,13,"Robin: I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney."
10398,35,2,13,"Barney: Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art."
10399,35,2,13,Ted:  Nude art.
10400,35,2,13,Robin:  Nude art.
10401,35,2,13,"Marshall: Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?"
10402,35,2,13,Lily: I knew this day would come.
10403,35,2,13,Marshall: How did you know that?
10404,35,2,13,Lily: Because I didn't hide it very well.
10405,35,2,13,"Flashback. In 1998, lily's on the bad while marshall's playing a videogame."
10406,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea."
10407,35,2,13,"Marshall: Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you."
10408,35,2,13,"Lily: It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall."
10409,35,2,13,Marshall: The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!
10410,35,2,13,"Lily: No, he's actually a little husky..."
10411,35,2,13,"Marshall: Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him."
10412,35,2,13,"Lily: Okay, just forget it."
10413,35,2,13,"Marshall: Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked."
10414,35,2,13,"Lily: Well, then you'll have to do it."
10415,35,2,13,Marshall: Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?
10416,35,2,13,Lily: We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.
10417,35,2,13,End of flashback.
10418,35,2,13,Barney: We totally saw your butt.
10419,35,2,13,Marshall: This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.
10420,35,2,13,"Barney: Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?"
10421,35,2,13,Marshall: Where is it?
10422,35,2,13,Barney: I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.
10423,35,2,13,"Marshall: You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?"
10424,35,2,13,"Barney: Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?"
10425,35,2,13,Ted: Field trip!
10426,35,2,13,Marshall comes running into the bar with the others
10427,35,2,13,"Barney: Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank."
10428,35,2,13,"Carl: Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?"
10429,35,2,13,"Marshall: What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!"
10430,35,2,13,"Carl: Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar."
10431,35,2,13,Marshall: I know that Barney gave you that painting.
10432,35,2,13,Carl: I don't know what you're talking about.
10433,35,2,13,"Marshall: Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double."
10434,35,2,13,Carl: I doubt it.
10435,35,2,13,"Marshall: Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks."
10436,35,2,13,Carl: I doubt it.
10437,35,2,13,"Marshall: All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer."
10438,35,2,13,Carl: I doubt it.
10439,35,2,13,Marshall: This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
10440,35,2,13,"Robin: Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?"
10441,35,2,13,"Barney: Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York..."
10442,35,2,13,"Marshall runs to the painting, takes it and goes out yelling."
10443,35,2,13,"Ted: One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office."
10444,35,2,13,"Robin: Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys."
10445,35,2,13,Ted and Robin leave. There's only Lily ant Barney left.
10446,35,2,13,"Lily: You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting."
10447,35,2,13,"Barney: Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great."
10448,35,2,13,Lily: Are you serious?
10449,35,2,13,Barney: Yeah.
10450,35,2,13,"Lily: Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?"
10451,35,2,13,Barney: Paint me.
10452,35,2,13,Lily: What?
10453,35,2,13,Barney: Paint me.
10454,35,2,13,Ted is at the office.
10455,35,2,13,Voice: Who's that? Who's out there?
10456,35,2,13,"Ted: Hammond, is that you?"
10457,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Mosby?
10458,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have."
10459,35,2,13,"Mr Druters: Uh, look, just a second, Ted."
10460,35,2,13,"Ted: Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?"
10461,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: What are you doing?
10462,35,2,13,Ted: I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?
10463,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off."
10464,35,2,13,"Ted: Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I..."
10465,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.
10466,35,2,13,Ted: It's okay.
10467,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: What did you want to say to me?
10468,35,2,13,"Ted: Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?"
10469,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?
10470,35,2,13,"Ted: Yeah, I do."
10471,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Cause I design homes.
10472,35,2,13,Ted: I see it.
10473,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: But I don't have a home.
10474,35,2,13,"Ted: Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building."
10475,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?"
10476,35,2,13,"Ted: Uh, no, I don't."
10477,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me."
10478,35,2,13,"Ted: Well, that's the dream."
10479,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted."
10480,35,2,13,"Ted: Me too, Hammond."
10481,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Call me Ham.
10482,35,2,13,"Ted: No, thanks."
10483,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: Hammy D?
10484,35,2,13,"Ted: No, I think just Hammond."
10485,35,2,13,
10486,35,2,13,Robin and Ted are at the apartment. Mr Druthers is on the couch.
10487,35,2,13,"Robin: So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him."
10488,35,2,13,Ted: I was this close.
10489,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma."
10490,35,2,13,Lily's trying to wake up marshall.
10491,35,2,13,"Lily: Oh honey, you're awake?"
10492,35,2,13,Marshall: I'm awake. Is everything okay?
10493,35,2,13,Lily: Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?
10494,35,2,13,"Marshall: Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns."
10495,35,2,13,"Lily: Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?"
10496,35,2,13,"Marshall: It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark."
10497,35,2,13,"Lily: Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?"
10498,35,2,13,Marshall: Loch Ness?
10499,35,2,13,"Lily: Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow..."
10500,35,2,13,"Marshall: Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that."
10501,35,2,13,Lily: Maybe we can.
10502,35,2,13,Flashback. Barney and lily are at Mclaren's.
10503,35,2,13,Barney: Paint me.
10504,35,2,13,"Lily: Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?"
10505,35,2,13,"Barney: We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story."
10506,35,2,13,"Lily: Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting."
10507,35,2,13,"Barney: Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago."
10508,35,2,13,Lily: Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.
10509,35,2,13,"Barney: I'll give you $5,000."
10510,35,2,13,End of flashback. Back to Lily and Marshall.
10511,35,2,13,Marshall: We're going to Loch Ness!
10512,35,2,13,Lily: Yeah!
10513,35,2,13,Ted arrives at the office.
10514,35,2,13,Ted: That cabby would not shut up.
10515,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Yeah, we should call him a gabby."
10516,35,2,13,"Ted: I think it, you say it."
10517,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell."
10518,35,2,13,"Ted: Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns."
10519,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez."
10520,35,2,13,Ted: What?
10521,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment..."
10522,35,2,13,Ted: Can I see you for one second?
10523,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Ooh, I'm in trouble now."
10524,35,2,13,"Ted: What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper."
10525,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.
10526,35,2,13,"Ted: What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my"
10527,35,2,13,"girlfriend's... sneakers, man, you have weirdly small feet."
10528,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now."
10529,35,2,13,Lily is with Barney in the room.
10530,35,2,13,"Lily: Okay, let's get this over with."
10531,35,2,13,"Barney: Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift."
10532,35,2,13,Lily: Thank you.
10533,35,2,13,"Barney: I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, ""There's stands Barnabus Stinson."" He was wise... and strong."
10534,35,2,13,Lily: I don't think your sword will fit.
10535,35,2,13,Barney: I get that a lot.
10536,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it."
10537,35,2,13,Marshall is at the bar with money on his hands.
10538,35,2,13,Marshall: This isn't right. This isn't right at all.
10539,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): Finally, he could take it no more."
10540,35,2,13,Back to the room where lily's painting.
10541,35,2,13,Lily: Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!
10542,35,2,13,Barney: Paint faster!
10543,35,2,13,"Lily: Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts."
10544,35,2,13,"Barney: Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man..."
10545,35,2,13,"Lily: Oh, just drop them!"
10546,35,2,13,Barney: All right.
10547,35,2,13,Marshall comes in.
10548,35,2,13,"Marshall: No! No, this is not right!"
10549,35,2,13,Barney: We had a deal!
10550,35,2,13,"Marshall: Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!"
10551,35,2,13,Barney: You...!
10552,35,2,13,"Marshall: It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted."
10553,35,2,13,(Yelling) I can't let the woman I love compromise her values for money! (whispering) I totally think we can get some more money out of him. (Yelling) I'm never letting my
10554,35,2,13,"fiancee, ever...! (he opens the door) Oh, you're still here?"
10555,35,2,13,"Barney: Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand."
10556,35,2,13,Marshall:  We accept.
10557,35,2,13,"Barney: You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance."
10558,35,2,13,Ted (voix off): And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.
10559,35,2,13,Ted is at the office.
10560,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers."
10561,35,2,13,"Ted: No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but..."
10562,35,2,13,Man: Looking for Hammond Druthers.
10563,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers."
10564,35,2,13,Man: These are divorce papers. You've been served.
10565,35,2,13,"Ted: Oh, God."
10566,35,2,13,Mr Druthers: She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.
10567,35,2,13,"Ted: There is no easy way to say this, but..."
10568,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him."
10569,35,2,13,"Ted: Believe me, there is no easy way to say this..."
10570,35,2,13,Men (singing): # Happy birthday to you... #
10571,35,2,13,Ted: You've got to be kidding me!
10572,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now."
10573,35,2,13,"Ted: Wait, his birthday was yesterday!"
10574,35,2,13,"Man: Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought..."
10575,35,2,13,"Ted: No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?"
10576,35,2,13,"Mr Druthers: Oh, God..."
10577,35,2,13,"Ted: Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly."
10578,35,2,13,"Ted (voix off): And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career."
10579,35,2,13,"Man: Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss."
10580,35,2,13,Lily is still painting
10581,35,2,13,"Lily: Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it."
10582,35,2,13,"Barney: Thank you very much, Lily."
10583,35,2,13,Lily steps out of the room.
10584,35,2,13,"Lily: Marshall, do you have the money?"
10585,35,2,13,Marshall: Yeah.
10586,35,2,13,Lily: Let's get out of here!
10587,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget."
10588,36,2,14,They're all at Mclaren's
10589,36,2,14,"Ted: Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem."
10590,36,2,14,"Barney: ""Problem."" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it."
10591,36,2,14,"Ted: And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter."
10592,36,2,14,"Marshall: If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that."
10593,36,2,14,The waitress: Here's the info for tomorrow night.
10594,36,2,14,Ted: What's tomorrow night?
10595,36,2,14,"The waitress: Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died."
10596,36,2,14,"Lily: Oh, my God."
10597,36,2,14,"Marshall: Oh, my gosh."
10598,36,2,14,"The waitress: The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers."
10599,36,2,14,All: Stay strong. We're so sorry. (the waitress leaves)
10600,36,2,14,Ted: Who was Mark?
10601,36,2,14,Marshall: No idea.
10602,36,2,14,Barney: Not a clue.
10603,36,2,14,"Lily: Well, I guess we should go, right?"
10604,36,2,14,"Marshall: Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl."
10605,36,2,14,"Ted: Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike."
10606,36,2,14,Lily: Mark.
10607,36,2,14,"Ted: Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?"
10608,36,2,14,All: Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.
10609,36,2,14,CREDITS
10610,36,2,14,At the apartment they're preparing for the funeral.
10611,36,2,14,"Ted: Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt..."
10612,36,2,14,Lily: Mark.
10613,36,2,14,"Ted: Mark, and start watching only an hour late."
10614,36,2,14,"Marshall: Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods."
10615,36,2,14,"Ted: Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the"
10616,36,2,14,alley with baseball bats.
10617,36,2,14,Marshall: Amen.
10618,36,2,14,Ted: Amen.
10619,36,2,14,Lily: We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.
10620,36,2,14,"Robin: Yeah, they're the best part."
10621,36,2,14,"Ted: Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?"
10622,36,2,14,"Robin: Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute."
10623,36,2,14,Barney comes into the apartment. He's on the phone.
10624,36,2,14,"Barney: Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy."
10625,36,2,14,Ted: So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?
10626,36,2,14,"Barney: Have I taught you nothing, Ted?"
10627,36,2,14,Ted: Virtually.
10628,36,2,14,Barney: Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.
10629,36,2,14,"Ted: Sartorial""?"
10630,36,2,14,"Barney: ""Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!"
10631,36,2,14,"At the funeral, they all see Mark and remember who he was."
10632,36,2,14,Barney: Such a waste.
10633,36,2,14,Lily: I know. He was so young.
10634,36,2,14,"Barney: A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened."
10635,36,2,14,"Robin: This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00."
10636,36,2,14,They're at the bar for the wake.
10637,36,2,14,"Carl: And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story."
10638,36,2,14,Marshall: Dibs on the one Carl just told.
10639,36,2,14,"Robin: Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now."
10640,36,2,14,"Lily: Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score."
10641,36,2,14,"Barney: Oh, thank God! I'll find out."
10642,36,2,14,"Ted: No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game."
10643,36,2,14,"Flashback. In 2003, they're all watching the Super Bowl."
10644,36,2,14,"Ted: Second down, everyone drink."
10645,36,2,14,"Barney: Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens."
10646,36,2,14,"Marshall: Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things."
10647,36,2,14,"Ted: I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!"
10648,36,2,14,"Marshall: Calm down, buddy."
10649,36,2,14,"Lily: Oh, commercials!"
10650,36,2,14,Ted: Everyone drink!
10651,36,2,14,In 2004.
10652,36,2,14,"Ted: God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?"
10653,36,2,14,"Marshall: Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal."
10654,36,2,14,Barney: I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.
10655,36,2,14,"Marshall: Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal."
10656,36,2,14,Barney: Fine.
10657,36,2,14,"Marshall: See, there you go, he made it. You win."
10658,36,2,14,"Barney: Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?"
10659,36,2,14,"Marshall: Nothing, it's the halftime show."
10660,36,2,14,"Lily: Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?"
10661,36,2,14,In 2006.
10662,36,2,14,"Ted: God, how cool is Robin?"
10663,36,2,14,Marshall: I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.
10664,36,2,14,"Barney: Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks."
10665,36,2,14,Marshall: Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
10666,36,2,14,"Barney: $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50."
10667,36,2,14,"Robin: Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious."
10668,36,2,14,End of flashback. Back to the bar.
10669,36,2,14,"Ted: Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won."
10670,36,2,14,Barney: That's impossible.
10671,36,2,14,"Ted: I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?"
10672,36,2,14,Lily: I'm in.
10673,36,2,14,Robin: I'm in.
10674,36,2,14,Marshall: I'm in.
10675,36,2,14,"Barney: What the hell, I'm in. High five!"
10676,36,2,14,"Ted: Dude, we're at a wake."
10677,36,2,14,Barney: Sorry. Solemn low five.
10678,36,2,14,Ted opens the door of his apartment to take the newspaper.
10679,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world."
10680,36,2,14,Barney comes in
10681,36,2,14,"Barney: Hey, take this key and swallow it."
10682,36,2,14,Ted: What? No.
10683,36,2,14,"Barney: Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time."
10684,36,2,14,"Ted: Lots more, no."
10685,36,2,14,"Barney: I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key."
10686,36,2,14,Ted: Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.
10687,36,2,14,Robin at work.
10688,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media."
10689,36,2,14,"Robin: But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one."
10690,36,2,14,Kevin: Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.
10691,36,2,14,"Man: You're right, Kevin."
10692,36,2,14,"Kevin: Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update."
10693,36,2,14,Robin: No!
10694,36,2,14,Kevin: What?
10695,36,2,14,Robin: No.
10696,36,2,14,"Kevin: But it's, uh, time for Sports."
10697,36,2,14,"Robin: No, it's not. It's time for Weather."
10698,36,2,14,"Kevin: We, we just did Weather."
10699,36,2,14,"Robin: Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?"
10700,36,2,14,"Lou: Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin."
10701,36,2,14,"Kevin: Okay, now it's time for Sports."
10702,36,2,14,Robin: No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.
10703,36,2,14,"Kevin: Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid."
10704,36,2,14,"Sid: Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl."
10705,36,2,14,Marshall is in Lily's classroom.
10706,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day."
10707,36,2,14,Lily: And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.
10708,36,2,14,"Marshall: Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like ""Monster."""
10709,36,2,14,"Lily: Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody."
10710,36,2,14,Doug: Hey. I'm Doug.
10711,36,2,14,"Marshall: Oh, hey, I'm Marshall."
10712,36,2,14,Doug: Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?
10713,36,2,14,"Marshall: Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl."
10714,36,2,14,Doug:  I know who won.
10715,36,2,14,"Marshall: Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself."
10716,36,2,14,Doug: How badly do you not want to know?
10717,36,2,14,Marshall: Excuse me?
10718,36,2,14,Doug: Ten bucks.
10719,36,2,14,Marshall: Are you serious?
10720,36,2,14,Doug: Just went up to eight.
10721,36,2,14,
10722,36,2,14,Ted's place. Barney's still tied up to the radiator.
10723,36,2,14,"Barney: Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries."
10724,36,2,14,Ted: Not until game time.
10725,36,2,14,Barney: Where are you going?
10726,36,2,14,Ted: Pick up the hot wings.
10727,36,2,14,Barney: What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.
10728,36,2,14,"Ted: Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000."
10729,36,2,14,Ted walks into a sports bar.
10730,36,2,14,"Ted: Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!"
10731,36,2,14,Back to Metro News One.
10732,36,2,14,"Sid: And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin."
10733,36,2,14,Robin has blocked her ears.
10734,36,2,14,Kevin: We'll be right back.
10735,36,2,14,Man: And we're clear.
10736,36,2,14,Robin: I'm sorry.
10737,36,2,14,"Woman: Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?"
10738,36,2,14,"Robin: I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific."
10739,36,2,14,Woman: That is crazy. I can't do that.
10740,36,2,14,Robin: My friend Mark passed away this week.
10741,36,2,14,"Woman: Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry."
10742,36,2,14,Man: Back in five... four... three...
10743,36,2,14,Robin: It's just so hard.
10744,36,2,14,"At the apartment, Barney's trying to free himself from the radiator. He finally does it and runs to the bathroom. 8 minutes and 23 seconds later Ted comes back with the chicken wings."
10745,36,2,14,Ted: Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!
10746,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization."
10747,36,2,14,Ted: Where's the dipping sauce?
10748,36,2,14,Marshall is still in lily's classroom. Lily's reading a book.
10749,36,2,14,"Doug: The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?"
10750,36,2,14,"Marshall: Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?"
10751,36,2,14,Doug: I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.
10752,36,2,14,"Marshall: Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine."
10753,36,2,14,Doug drops an object and breaks it.
10754,36,2,14,"Lily: Okay, now who did this?"
10755,36,2,14,Marshall: I did.
10756,36,2,14,Doug: Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?
10757,36,2,14,"Lily: Well, Marshall's a grownup, so..."
10758,36,2,14,"Doug: When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out."
10759,36,2,14,Lily: Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.
10760,36,2,14,At Robin's work.
10761,36,2,14,"Robin: And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor."
10762,36,2,14,Back to lily's classroom.
10763,36,2,14,Doug: Hey. Hey.
10764,36,2,14,Marshall: I'm not talking to you.
10765,36,2,14,"Doug: Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath."
10766,36,2,14,Marshall: I'm not holding my breath.
10767,36,2,14,Doug: The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...
10768,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times..."
10769,36,2,14,Marshall takes a glass of water and throwns it on Doug's pants.
10770,36,2,14,"Marshall: Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants."
10771,36,2,14,"Doug: No, I didn't."
10772,36,2,14,"Marshall: Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone..."
10773,36,2,14,"Doug: Okay, okay. You win."
10774,36,2,14,Marshall: I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.
10775,36,2,14,Barney's running on the street.
10776,36,2,14,"Barney: Sir, who won the Super Bowl?"
10777,36,2,14,Man: Sorry. I missed the game.
10778,36,2,14,Barney: You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!
10779,36,2,14,Man 2: I... don't really follow sports.
10780,36,2,14,"Barney: Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God."
10781,36,2,14,"Emmitt Smith: Yeah, I get that a lot."
10782,36,2,14,"Barney: You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?"
10783,36,2,14,"Emmitt Smith: The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh."
10784,36,2,14,"Barney: But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!"
10785,36,2,14,"Emmitt Smith: Dance, my friend. Dance."
10786,36,2,14,Barney: No...!
10787,36,2,14,Barney's on the knees. Ted walks passed him but doesn't see him with his glasses.
10788,36,2,14,Ted: Hello! It's me again.
10789,36,2,14,Barman: Oh! I didn't recognize you.
10790,36,2,14,"Ted: Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one."
10791,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong."
10792,36,2,14,Robin's finishing the news.
10793,36,2,14,Robin: And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.
10794,36,2,14,Lily's closing the classroom and Marshall's drinking at a fountain when the cleaner walks there with his radio.
10795,36,2,14,Barney is still in the street looking for the results and he finds kiosk.
10796,36,2,14,Ted's leaving the sports bar.
10797,36,2,14,"Man 1: Hey, buddy."
10798,36,2,14,"Man 2: Hey, dude, look out."
10799,36,2,14,At the Bronx Zoo.
10800,36,2,14,Trish Sanchez: And in honor of yesterday's big win...
10801,36,2,14,At the sports bar.
10802,36,2,14,"Man 1: Hey, buddy, look out."
10803,36,2,14,"Man 2: Dude, watch out!"
10804,36,2,14,At the Zoo.
10805,36,2,14,Trish Sanchez: ...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions...
10806,36,2,14,Robin: No...!
10807,36,2,14,Marshall (at school): No...!
10808,36,2,14,Barney (tearing the newspaper): No...!
10809,36,2,14,Ted falls without dropping the sauce.
10810,36,2,14,Ted: Yes...!
10811,36,2,14,"Monday, 18h15, Robin, Marshall and Lily comes into the apartment."
10812,36,2,14,"Ted: Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right?"
10813,36,2,14,Robin: Mission accomplished.
10814,36,2,14,Lily: Didn't find out.
10815,36,2,14,"Ted: Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won."
10816,36,2,14,"Ted: Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game."
10817,36,2,14,"Ted: Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone."
10818,36,2,14,"Lily: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney."
10819,36,2,14,Robin: Way to blow it.
10820,36,2,14,"Marshall: Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know."
10821,36,2,14,Ted: There's no point in even watching the game.
10822,36,2,14,"Lily: Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined."
10823,36,2,14,Marshall: Wings are still good.
10824,36,2,14,Robin: Beer still works.
10825,36,2,14,"Ted: Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money."
10826,36,2,14,"Marshall: Hey, so check this out: I got extorted by a five-year-old today."
10827,36,2,14,Robin: I almost got fired today.
10828,36,2,14,Barney: I met Emmitt Smith today.
10829,36,2,14,"Lily: Ooh, you go first."
10830,36,2,14,Ted: I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.
10831,36,2,14,"Lily: Yeah, go ahead, Barney."
10832,36,2,14,"Barney: Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game..."
10833,36,2,14,"Ted (voix off): And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?"
10834,36,2,14,Ted and Barney are at Mclaren's.
10835,36,2,14,"Barney: I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?"
10836,36,2,14,"Ted: 50-50, give or take."
10837,36,2,14,"Barney: Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first..."
10838,37,2,15,"Ted (voix off): Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago."
10839,37,2,15,2007. Robin and Ted are running in a airport.
10840,37,2,15,Robin: That security guard was a little bit handsy.
10841,37,2,15,"Ted: That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself."
10842,37,2,15,Ted (voix off): Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.
10843,37,2,15,Robin and Ted arrive at the gate.
10844,37,2,15,"Ted: Hi, wait, two more."
10845,37,2,15,"Woman: Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors."
10846,37,2,15,"Ted: Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them."
10847,37,2,15,"Woman: Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy."
10848,37,2,15,"Ted: Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job."
10849,37,2,15,"Woman: I'm sorry, sir."
10850,37,2,15,"Robin: His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job."
10851,37,2,15,"Ted: Please, I have to be on this flight."
10852,37,2,15,Woman: I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.
10853,37,2,15,Ted: Thanks.
10854,37,2,15,Robin: Your uniforms are pretty.
10855,37,2,15,CREDITS
10856,37,2,15,"Woman: Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back."
10857,37,2,15,"Ted: Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything."
10858,37,2,15,"Woman: Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after."
10859,37,2,15,"Ted: Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything."
10860,37,2,15,"Rubin: Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile."
10861,37,2,15,"Woman: You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?"
10862,37,2,15,Ted: That thing better have call waiting.
10863,37,2,15,Robin: Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?
10864,37,2,15,Ted: It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?
10865,37,2,15,"Robin: Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?"
10866,37,2,15,Ted (voix off): She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.
10867,37,2,15,"Flashback. A few months earlier Marshall, Lily, Robin and Ted are at Mclaren's."
10868,37,2,15,"Robin: Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?"
10869,37,2,15,"Marshall: Oh, man, it kills."
10870,37,2,15,"Lily: You want some aspirin, baby?"
10871,37,2,15,Marshall: You know I don't believe in pain killers.
10872,37,2,15,"Ted: Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole ""Unbreakable"" theory."
10873,37,2,15,Lily: Marshall used to think he was indestructible.
10874,37,2,15,"Marshall: Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door."
10875,37,2,15,Ted: There was a really heavy door. He opened it.
10876,37,2,15,Marshall: On one pull.
10877,37,2,15,"Robin: Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow."
10878,37,2,15,"Marshall: Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste."
10879,37,2,15,Barney: Training for a marathon.
10880,37,2,15,Marshall: What?
10881,37,2,15,Barney: You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.
10882,37,2,15,"Marshall: You're kidding, right?"
10883,37,2,15,Barney: Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.
10884,37,2,15,"Marshall: So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?"
10885,37,2,15,Barney: Absolutely.
10886,37,2,15,"Robin: Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers."
10887,37,2,15,"Ted: Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles."
10888,37,2,15,"Barney: Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two."
10889,37,2,15,Marshall:
10890,37,2,15,"Okay, you know what? Prove it. Take my number and run in my place. I will bet you 50 bucks you don't even finish the race."
10891,37,2,15,"Barney: 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000."
10892,37,2,15,Marshall: You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.
10893,37,2,15,"Barney: Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50."
10894,37,2,15,"Ted (voix off): The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer."
10895,37,2,15,"Marshall: Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe."
10896,37,2,15,"Robin: Ooh, he's starting!"
10897,37,2,15,Marshall: This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint.
10898,37,2,15,"Lily: This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these."
10899,37,2,15,53 minutes later...
10900,37,2,15,Robin: Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.
10901,37,2,15,"Marshall: He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check."
10902,37,2,15,"Ted: Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang ""Hungry Like the Wolf,"" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?"
10903,37,2,15,"Marshall: Well, it looks like, ""Barney"" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him."
10904,37,2,15,"Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin are on the course to see if Barney's running."
10905,37,2,15,Marshall: It's really him.
10906,37,2,15,A runner takes lily's water.
10907,37,2,15,"Lily: Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!"
10908,37,2,15,Back to the apartment...
10909,37,2,15,"Barney: What up, non-finishers?"
10910,37,2,15,"Ted: Wow. Very impressive, Barney."
10911,37,2,15,"Barney: Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won."
10912,37,2,15,Lily: I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.
10913,37,2,15,Barney: So where's my 50 bucks?
10914,37,2,15,"Marshall: All right. I got to admit, you earned this."
10915,37,2,15,"Barney: Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym."
10916,37,2,15,"Marshall: Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today."
10917,37,2,15,"Barney: Wow. You know I really should check out this ""subway."" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight."
10918,37,2,15,Ted: You're dating a girl from New Jersey?
10919,37,2,15,Barney: No.
10920,37,2,15,Barney leaves the apartment...
10921,37,2,15,Ted (voix off): So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.
10922,37,2,15,Ted: Hello?
10923,37,2,15,"Barney: Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway."
10924,37,2,15,"Ted: What, what are you talking about?"
10925,37,2,15,"Barney: I was sitting here, totally minding my own business."
10926,37,2,15,"Flashback. 2 hours earlier, Barney is sitting on the subway next to two girls."
10927,37,2,15,"Barney: Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean."
10928,37,2,15,Voice: 86th street.
10929,37,2,15,Barney stands up but fell. The Subway continues.
10930,37,2,15,End of flashback.
10931,37,2,15,"Barney: My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around."
10932,37,2,15,Ted: (to Marshall) Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.
10933,37,2,15,Marshall: Best 50 bucks I ever spent.
10934,37,2,15,"Barney: Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?"
10935,37,2,15,Ted: All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.
10936,37,2,15,"Barney: Ted, Ted."
10937,37,2,15,"A pregnant woman, on ald lady and a boy in crutches wait for Barney to give up his place."
10938,37,2,15,"Woman: Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?"
10939,37,2,15,Barney: I'm sorry. I can't.
10940,37,2,15,Old lady: Douche.
10941,37,2,15,"25 minutes later, Ted arrives at the station."
10942,37,2,15,Ted: Barney?!
10943,37,2,15,Barney: Ted!
10944,37,2,15,Ted jumpes a subway turnstile A policeman catches him.
10945,37,2,15,Policeman: Hey!
10946,37,2,15,Barney: No...!
10947,37,2,15,End of flashbacks. Back to the airport with Robin and Ted.
10948,37,2,15,"Robin: See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight."
10949,37,2,15,Ted: You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.
10950,37,2,15,Woman: So I was able to get you two seats.
10951,37,2,15,Ted: Really? That's great!
10952,37,2,15,"Woman: No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?"
10953,37,2,15,"Ted: Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?"
10954,37,2,15,Woman: I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.
10955,37,2,15,"Ted: What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today."
10956,37,2,15,"Robin: Well, he never even called you back?"
10957,37,2,15,"Woman: Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando."
10958,37,2,15,"Ted (voix off): It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport."
10959,37,2,15,Robin: What was the name of the airline again?
10960,37,2,15,Ted: I think it was something like Flights R' Us.
10961,37,2,15,"Robin: Was the ""R"" backwards?"
10962,37,2,15,"Ted: God, I hope not."
10963,37,2,15,Robin: Geez.
10964,37,2,15,Ted: Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.
10965,37,2,15,"Robin: If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault."
10966,37,2,15,"Ted: You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe."
10967,37,2,15,"Robin: Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?"
10968,37,2,15,"Ted (voix off): For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April."
10969,37,2,15,
10970,37,2,15,April 2006. Marshall and Lily are in the bathroom.
10971,37,2,15,Marshall: My pants are starting to feel a little tight.
10972,37,2,15,"Lily: Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly."
10973,37,2,15,Marshall: I cannot allow this.
10974,37,2,15,Lily: What?
10975,37,2,15,Marshall: I am going to run the New York City Marathon.
10976,37,2,15,Marshall starts training for the marathon.
10977,37,2,15,"Lily: ""It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice."" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said."
10978,37,2,15,"Marshall: Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run."
10979,37,2,15,"Lily: ""Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement."""
10980,37,2,15,Marshall: This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!
10981,37,2,15,"Lily: ""Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas."""
10982,37,2,15,Marshall comes into the apartment scratching himself and goes to the bathroom.
10983,37,2,15,"Marshall: Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you."
10984,37,2,15,Robin comes in the bathroom behind Marshall.
10985,37,2,15,"Robin: Marshall? Oh, my God!"
10986,37,2,15,End of flashback. Back to the airport...
10987,37,2,15,"Ted: So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport."
10988,37,2,15,Robin: That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on
10989,37,2,15,"Marshall if it weren't for Lily. Hey, think about it."
10990,37,2,15,Flasback. Ted and Robin eat while walking on the street.
10991,37,2,15,"Robin: Hey, what's going on here?"
10992,37,2,15,"Ted: Oh, looks like they're camping out for something."
10993,37,2,15,"Robin: Yeah, but for what?"
10994,37,2,15,"Ted: I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. ""Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."""
10995,37,2,15,"Robin: Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?"
10996,37,2,15,"Barney, Ted, Lily and Robin are at Mclaren's."
10997,37,2,15,Lily: We have to camp out.
10998,37,2,15,Robin: Are you serious?
10999,37,2,15,"Lily: You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun."
11000,37,2,15,Barney:  I can't go. I've got this thing.
11001,37,2,15,Lily: What thing?
11002,37,2,15,Barney: A pen1s.
11003,37,2,15,Lily and Robin arrive at the wedding dress shop.
11004,37,2,15,Robin: This is the place.
11005,37,2,15,"Lily: Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?"
11006,37,2,15,Robin: You said wang.
11007,37,2,15,"Lily: Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets."
11008,37,2,15,"Robin: You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York."
11009,37,2,15,"Lily: Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep."
11010,37,2,15,On alarm starts beeping.
11011,37,2,15,Robin: That's kind of annoying.
11012,37,2,15,"Lily: Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?"
11013,37,2,15,"Robin: It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?"
11014,37,2,15,"3 hours later, the alarm didnt' turned off."
11015,37,2,15,"Lily: If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently."
11016,37,2,15,Robin: I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.
11017,37,2,15,A man comes and shut down the alarm.
11018,37,2,15,"Man: Morning, ladies."
11019,37,2,15,Lily: It's him. It's the car guy!
11020,37,2,15,Robin: Get out of here!
11021,37,2,15,All women throw things at him.
11022,37,2,15,"Ted (voix off): The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when..."
11023,37,2,15,Marshall: Nobody does it better than you.
11024,37,2,15,"Robin: Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)"
11025,37,2,15,End of flashback. At the airport.
11026,37,2,15,"Robin: So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight."
11027,37,2,15,"Ted: Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight."
11028,37,2,15,"Man: Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1."
11029,37,2,15,"Robin: Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me."
11030,37,2,15,Man: You did that story on the giant pizzas?
11031,37,2,15,Ted: Would you check to see if you have any more seats?
11032,37,2,15,"Man: One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?"
11033,37,2,15,Ted: Robin...
11034,37,2,15,"Robin:  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,"
11035,37,2,15,the pizzas were real. - Calzones. Trick photography.
11036,37,2,15,Man:  I knew it!
11037,37,2,15,"Robin: God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight."
11038,37,2,15,"Man: Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out."
11039,37,2,15,Ted: Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?
11040,37,2,15,Man: I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.
11041,37,2,15,"Robin: Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?"
11042,37,2,15,Ted: No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?
11043,37,2,15,Flashback. Ted is in the subway.
11044,37,2,15,Ted: 1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?
11045,37,2,15,"Robin: Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting."
11046,37,2,15,"Ted: Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector."
11047,37,2,15,"Robin: No, it's not."
11048,37,2,15,"Ted: Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy."
11049,37,2,15,Ted( voix off): And that's exactly what I did.
11050,37,2,15,They're on the street.
11051,37,2,15,Robin: You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.
11052,37,2,15,"Ted: Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984."
11053,37,2,15,"Robin: Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again."
11054,37,2,15,Ted: How dare you.
11055,37,2,15,"Robin: Hey, what's going on?"
11056,37,2,15,Ted: I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.
11057,37,2,15,"Robin: Yeah, but for what?"
11058,37,2,15,End of flashback. Back to the airport.
11059,37,2,15,"Ted: It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town."
11060,37,2,15,"Robin: And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day."
11061,37,2,15,"Ted: Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date..."
11062,37,2,15,Robin: And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.
11063,37,2,15,"Ted: I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that."
11064,37,2,15,"Man: Uh, sir?"
11065,37,2,15,"Ted: Oh, please tell me you have some good news."
11066,37,2,15,"Man: Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry."
11067,37,2,15,"Robin: All, right, well, thanks for trying."
11068,37,2,15,"Ted: I can't believe this. That's it, it's over."
11069,37,2,15,"Robin: Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule."
11070,37,2,15,"Ted (voix off): But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother."
11071,38,2,16,"Ted (voix off): Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk."
11072,38,2,16,Ted and Robin are et the bar.
11073,38,2,16,Robin: How about Mimi's?
11074,38,2,16,"Ted: Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's."
11075,38,2,16,"Robin: Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go."
11076,38,2,16,"Ted: Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?"
11077,38,2,16,Robin: We did?
11078,38,2,16,"Ted: Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, ""You two should get married! You two should get married!"""
11079,38,2,16,Ted (voix off): It's also important to know when to stop talking.
11080,38,2,16,Ted: Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?
11081,38,2,16,Robin: Because it wasn't me.
11082,38,2,16,"Ted: Oh, right! It was... my sister."
11083,38,2,16,"Ted (voix off): You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't."
11084,38,2,16,Ted and Robin are at the apartment.
11085,38,2,16,"Ted: Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row."
11086,38,2,16,Robin: I've never seen Van Helsing.
11087,38,2,16,Ted:  That's right. I saw it with my sister.
11088,38,2,16,Robin: My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.
11089,38,2,16,"Ted: Oh, it's so romantic."
11090,38,2,16,Robin: When were you in Maui?
11091,38,2,16,Ted: I... went... with my sister.
11092,38,2,16,"Robin: With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't."
11093,38,2,16,Ted: You're right. We should just be honest.
11094,38,2,16,Robin: Totally.
11095,38,2,16,They're back at the bar.
11096,38,2,16,"Ted: See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her."
11097,38,2,16,Robin: I don't want to hear that.
11098,38,2,16,Ted: What? You said...
11099,38,2,16,"Robin: God, that is so insensitive."
11100,38,2,16,Ted: Remember honesty...?
11101,38,2,16,Robin: You're a jerk!
11102,38,2,16,"Ted: Well, you're...confusing."
11103,38,2,16,CREDITS
11104,38,2,16,Marshall is at the bar with Barney.
11105,38,2,16,"Marshall: Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!"
11106,38,2,16,Barney: I don't know. Is she fat?
11107,38,2,16,"Marshall: Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat."
11108,38,2,16,Lily: Hot off the presses!
11109,38,2,16,Barney: I-I don't take flyers.
11110,38,2,16,Marshall: You took one two seconds before you walked in here.
11111,38,2,16,Barney: That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?
11112,38,2,16,Lily: Fine. It's a flyer from my play.
11113,38,2,16,"Barney: Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid..."
11114,38,2,16,"Marshall: Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good."
11115,38,2,16,"Barney: Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play."
11116,38,2,16,"Ted: Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us."
11117,38,2,16,"Barney: Yes, you should break up."
11118,38,2,16,"Ted: So, earlier tonight..."
11119,38,2,16,Flashback. Ted and Robin are on the couch.
11120,38,2,16,"Robin: Mm, we should get down to the bar."
11121,38,2,16,"Ted: I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt."
11122,38,2,16,End flashback.
11123,38,2,16,"Barney: Oh, God, why is this part of the story?"
11124,38,2,16,Ted: We're getting to it.
11125,38,2,16,Flashback.
11126,38,2,16,"Robin: Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?"
11127,38,2,16,"Ted: Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist."
11128,38,2,16,End flashback.
11129,38,2,16,"Lily: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
11130,38,2,16,Barney: What's wrong with her?
11131,38,2,16,Marshall: She hates that word.
11132,38,2,16,"Barney: What word, ""moist""?"
11133,38,2,16,"Lily: No! Seriously, stop!"
11134,38,2,16,"Robin: So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion..."
11135,38,2,16,Flashback.
11136,38,2,16,"Robin: Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion."
11137,38,2,16,Ted: What are you talking about? It's yours.
11138,38,2,16,"Robin: No, it's not."
11139,38,2,16,"Ted: Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's."
11140,38,2,16,End flashback.
11141,38,2,16,"Lily: No, it's not."
11142,38,2,16,Flashback.
11143,38,2,16,"Robin: Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?"
11144,38,2,16,"Ted: Um, my sister's."
11145,38,2,16,"Robin: So, in other words, some girl you went out with."
11146,38,2,16,Ted: Um... I love you.
11147,38,2,16,Robin: Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?
11148,38,2,16,End flashback.
11149,38,2,16,Lily: It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.
11150,38,2,16,Marshall: I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.
11151,38,2,16,"Ted: Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much."
11152,38,2,16,Flashback.
11153,38,2,16,Robin: Why is that still in your apartment?
11154,38,2,16,Ted: I don't know. I just never threw it out.
11155,38,2,16,"Robin: Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?"
11156,38,2,16,"Ted: Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion."
11157,38,2,16,Robin: Not three dollars! Try 14.
11158,38,2,16,Ted: Why is this such a big deal?
11159,38,2,16,Robin: Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!
11160,38,2,16,"Ted: Whoa, she wasn't a whore."
11161,38,2,16,"Robin: Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?"
11162,38,2,16,"Ted: Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the..."
11163,38,2,16,"Robin: No. No! No! Oh, Ted!"
11164,38,2,16,End flashback.
11165,38,2,16,"Lily: Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?"
11166,38,2,16,"Robin: Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it."
11167,38,2,16,"Ted: Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it."
11168,38,2,16,Robin: So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.
11169,38,2,16,"Ted: Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants."
11170,38,2,16,"Barney: Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants."
11171,38,2,16,Flashback. Marshall comes in with pants.
11172,38,2,16,"Marshall: Nice, right?"
11173,38,2,16,Robin: I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old
11174,38,2,16,girl falling in love with you and then shooting Lily in the face.
11175,38,2,16,Lily: Yes!
11176,38,2,16,"Barney: I vote they can stay. ""Check out the jackass in the parachute pants"" is a good icebreaker."
11177,38,2,16,Marshall: Ted. Ted? Ted?
11178,38,2,16,"Ted: Sorry, buddy, it's a ""no"" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back."
11179,38,2,16,End flashback.
11180,38,2,16,Marshall: They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.
11181,38,2,16,"Barney: Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots."
11182,38,2,16,"Lily: All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first."
11183,38,2,16,"Ted: Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there."
11184,38,2,16,"Marshall: Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time."
11185,38,2,16,"Robin: Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see."
11186,38,2,16,The phone booth turns into Ted's ex-girlfriend.
11187,38,2,16,Ex-girlfriend 1: I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?
11188,38,2,16,The lamp turns into Ted's ex-girlfriend.
11189,38,2,16,"Ex-girlfriend 2: He calls you ""sweetie pie""? He called me ""sweetie pie."""
11190,38,2,16,The pillow turns into Ted's ex-girlfriend.
11191,38,2,16,"Ex-girlfriend 3: I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours."
11192,38,2,16,Ted: Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!
11193,38,2,16,"Robin: Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross."
11194,38,2,16,Ted: You're creepy and gross.
11195,38,2,16,Robin: Your mom's creepy and gross.
11196,38,2,16,"Lily: Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it."
11197,38,2,16,Marshall: I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.
11198,38,2,16,"Ted: All right, Barney. It all comes down to you."
11199,38,2,16,Barney: I side with Robin.
11200,38,2,16,Ted: What?
11201,38,2,16,"Barney: Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's."
11202,38,2,16,"Robin: Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?"
11203,38,2,16,"Ted: Just stop, sweetie."
11204,38,2,16,Ted is getting rid off his ex-girlfriends stuff.
11205,38,2,16,"Ted (voix off): So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in."
11206,38,2,16,"Ted, Robin and Barney arrive in the room where Lily's going to play."
11207,38,2,16,"Robin: Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?"
11208,38,2,16,"Barney: From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory."
11209,38,2,16,Ted: Where do you guys want to sit?
11210,38,2,16,Barney: I know where I don't want to sit.
11211,38,2,16,"Marshall (in the front row): Guys, four together!"
11212,38,2,16,Barney: I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
11213,38,2,16,Robin: Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
11214,38,2,16,Barney: No? Okay.
11215,38,2,16,
11216,38,2,16,The lights turn off and the play starts.
11217,38,2,16,Man 1: I... am... Rage!
11218,38,2,16,Woman: I... am Greed.
11219,38,2,16,Lily: I am Rage... Envy!
11220,38,2,16,Barney: I am outta here.
11221,38,2,16,"Marshall: No, you're not. You have to stay."
11222,38,2,16,Lily: This is the face of Consumerism!
11223,38,2,16,"Marshall: Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play."
11224,38,2,16,"Man 2: Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!"
11225,38,2,16,3 hours later the play is over.
11226,38,2,16,"Marshall: Oh, baby, that was wonderful!"
11227,38,2,16,"Ted: Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer."
11228,38,2,16,"Robin: And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, ""Now we are really cookin'!"""
11229,38,2,16,"Barney: Wow, Lily, that sucked!"
11230,38,2,16,Marshall: Barney!
11231,38,2,16,"Barney: What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends."
11232,38,2,16,"Lily: No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about."
11233,38,2,16,"Barney: Yeah, if you're a Smurf."
11234,38,2,16,"Lily: You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards."
11235,38,2,16,"Barney: Oh, really? You would?"
11236,38,2,16,Lily: Yes.
11237,38,2,16,"Barney: Bad move, Aldrin, bad move."
11238,38,2,16,Man: We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out
11239,38,2,16,Robin and Ted arrive at Ted's apartment.
11240,38,2,16,Robin: Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?
11241,38,2,16,Ted: I know. He can be really insensitive.
11242,38,2,16,"Robin: It was pretty bad, though."
11243,38,2,16,"Ted: Oh, my God, it was so bad."
11244,38,2,16,"Robin: Oh, my God, you've been robbed!"
11245,38,2,16,Ted: Nope.
11246,38,2,16,Robin: All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?
11247,38,2,16,Ted: What can I say? Papa gets swag.
11248,38,2,16,Ted (voix off): And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...
11249,38,2,16,Ted is walking the dogs with Robin.
11250,38,2,16,"Ted: You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it."
11251,38,2,16,"Robin: Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired."
11252,38,2,16,"Ted: Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?"
11253,38,2,16,"Robin: Nope. Well, except for my dogs."
11254,38,2,16,At Robin's apartment.
11255,38,2,16,"Ted: So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships."
11256,38,2,16,"Robin: What's your point, Ted?"
11257,38,2,16,"Ted: Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?"
11258,38,2,16,"Robin: What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?"
11259,38,2,16,Ted: I do now.
11260,38,2,16,Robin: That's ridiculous.
11261,38,2,16,"Ted: I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs."
11262,38,2,16,Ted: You said everything.
11263,38,2,16,Robin: But not living things.
11264,38,2,16,"Ted: Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away."
11265,38,2,16,Robin: Things with a heartbeat can stay.
11266,38,2,16,Ted: Enjoying this?
11267,38,2,16,"Robin: Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball."
11268,38,2,16,Ted: Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.
11269,38,2,16,"Robin: Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?"
11270,38,2,16,The dog turns into a man.
11271,38,2,16,Man: Guess what position we did it in.
11272,38,2,16,"Ted: Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs."
11273,38,2,16,"Robin: Um, no."
11274,38,2,16,"Ted: Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances."
11275,38,2,16,They're all at the bar.
11276,38,2,16,Marshall: She's not getting rid of the dogs.
11277,38,2,16,Lily: What's the matter with you?
11278,38,2,16,Barney: Even I wouldn't do that.
11279,38,2,16,Robin: Yes!
11280,38,2,16,"Lily: You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog."
11281,38,2,16,Marshall: I miss Jebediah.
11282,38,2,16,"Barney: Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play."
11283,38,2,16,Lily: Very funny.
11284,38,2,16,"Barney: Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends."
11285,38,2,16,"Lily: Oh, we'll be there."
11286,38,2,16,"Barney: Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong..."
11287,38,2,16,Lily: Never.
11288,38,2,16,"Barney: Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet."
11289,38,2,16,Robin and Ted are in Robin's apartment.
11290,38,2,16,Robin: I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.
11291,38,2,16,Ted: I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.
11292,38,2,16,Robin: So we're-we're okay?
11293,38,2,16,"Ted: Yeah, we're great."
11294,38,2,16,"Ted (voix off): And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head."
11295,38,2,16,Robin has one of her dog in her knees but Ted sees a man instead.
11296,38,2,16,"Man: Oh, yeah, that's the spot."
11297,38,2,16,Robin and Ted are kissing on the bed when a man (dog) interrupts them.
11298,38,2,16,"Man: Dude, I gotta pee."
11299,38,2,16,Ted: I gotta go.
11300,38,2,16,The gang is at Barney's play.
11301,38,2,16,"Lily: Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?"
11302,38,2,16,"Robin: Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm."
11303,38,2,16,Lily: You're gonna kill your dogs?!
11304,38,2,16,"Robin: No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate."
11305,38,2,16,"Lily: Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn."
11306,38,2,16,"Robin: Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty."
11307,38,2,16,"Lily: Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs."
11308,38,2,16,"Robin: ""They""? What do you mean by ""they""?"
11309,38,2,16,"Lily: Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!"
11310,38,2,16,"Marshall: Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be..."
11311,38,2,16,"Lily: I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do."
11312,38,2,16,Barney's play starts.
11313,38,2,16,Barney: Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.
11314,38,2,16,Ted (voix off): That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.
11315,38,2,16,Barney: Moist.
11316,38,2,16,Ted (voix off): And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.
11317,38,2,16,Barney shoots at Lily with a water gun.
11318,38,2,16,Barney: I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.
11319,38,2,16,Marshall: I never get picked for audience participation.
11320,38,2,16,Ted (voix off): And then it just got weird.
11321,38,2,16,"Barney: Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!"
11322,38,2,16,Ted (voix off): And when that didn't work...
11323,38,2,16,"Lily: Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show."
11324,38,2,16,"Barney: Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?"
11325,38,2,16,"Lily: No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar."
11326,38,2,16,"Barney: Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting"
11327,38,2,16,"warmed up, man!"
11328,38,2,16,"Lily: Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go."
11329,38,2,16,Barney: Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.
11330,38,2,16,"Lily: Yeah, well, anyway."
11331,38,2,16,"Barney: Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?"
11332,38,2,16,"Barney: It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two."
11333,38,2,16,"Ted (voix off): So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently."
11334,38,2,16,Ted is about te enter in his apartment.
11335,38,2,16,Robin: Hey.
11336,38,2,16,Ted: Where've you been? I called you earlier.
11337,38,2,16,Robin: I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
11338,38,2,16,Ted: You what?
11339,38,2,16,"Robin: Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best."
11340,38,2,16,"Ted: Wow. Oh, man."
11341,38,2,16,Robin: Can we go inside?
11342,38,2,16,"Ted: Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar."
11343,38,2,16,Robin: Why? What's going on inside?
11344,38,2,16,"Ted: Um, the floors are gone."
11345,38,2,16,Robin: What?
11346,38,2,16,"Ted: Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail."
11347,38,2,16,Robin walks into the apartment and Ted brought back all his ex-girlfriends stuff.
11348,38,2,16,Ted: I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!
11349,38,2,16,Robin: You said you threw all that stuff away!
11350,38,2,16,"Ted (voix off): Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here."
11351,38,2,16,Robin: We're really doing this?
11352,38,2,16,Ted: Yeah.
11353,38,2,16,At the bar...
11354,38,2,16,Ted and Robin: We're moving in together!
11355,38,2,16,During Barney's play...
11356,38,2,16,"Barney: The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four."
11357,38,2,16,Marshall stand up and slaps Barney.
11358,39,2,17,Ted and Marshall are in a car.
11359,39,2,17,Ted: This is awesome.
11360,39,2,17,"Marshall: I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000."
11361,39,2,17,"Ted: Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back."
11362,39,2,17,"Marshall: Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment."
11363,39,2,17,"Ted: Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins."
11364,39,2,17,Marshal: What are you talking about?
11365,39,2,17,"Ted: Whoa, pothole. The car stops."
11366,39,2,17,"Marshall: What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!"
11367,39,2,17,Ted: Is it cool if I still light these?
11368,39,2,17,CREDITS
11369,39,2,17,"Ted (voix off): Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, ""This is who I really am."" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero."
11370,39,2,17,Ted and Marshall are in a garage.
11371,39,2,17,Ted: Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.
11372,39,2,17,Marshall: Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.
11373,39,2,17,"Ted: Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak."
11374,39,2,17,"Lily, Robin and Barney arrive at the garage."
11375,39,2,17,Lily: Surprise.
11376,39,2,17,"Robin: We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here."
11377,39,2,17,Barney: We insisted.
11378,39,2,17,Ted: Terrific.
11379,39,2,17,Barney: How's the Fiero?
11380,39,2,17,Marshall: She's still in triage.
11381,39,2,17,Ted: She? I thought it was your little boy.
11382,39,2,17,"Lily: Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car."
11383,39,2,17,Robin: How long have you had her... slash him?
11384,39,2,17,Marshall: My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.
11385,39,2,17,"Robin: Oh, how nice of them."
11386,39,2,17,Marshall: Not really.
11387,39,2,17,Flashback. Marshall is in the front of his house with his brothers.
11388,39,2,17,Brother 1: Congratulations.
11389,39,2,17,Brother 2: The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test.
11390,39,2,17,Marshall: Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out.
11391,39,2,17,Brother 1: Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee.
11392,39,2,17,Marshall: That's it?
11393,39,2,17,"Brother 2: Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear."
11394,39,2,17,Marshall: Agreed. Totally agreed.
11395,39,2,17,Marshall is in a drive-in naked in his car.
11396,39,2,17,Man: You're naked.
11397,39,2,17,Marshall: I'm aware of that.
11398,39,2,17,Man: You have 50 cents?
11399,39,2,17,"Marshall: No... Look, can I just have my coffee, please?"
11400,39,2,17,"Man: Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all."
11401,39,2,17,"Marshall puts the cups of coffee in the car, then his brothers jump at him to scare him, so Marshall stops the car and because of it all the cups of coffee fall on him and it burns him."
11402,39,2,17,End of flashback.
11403,39,2,17,"Ted: And that is the origin of Marshall's insane ""no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries"" rule."
11404,39,2,17,Marshall: It is not insane.
11405,39,2,17,Lily: Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.
11406,39,2,17,"Barney: Well, I'm trying, but it's..."
11407,39,2,17,"Lily: Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?"
11408,39,2,17,"Barney: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it."
11409,39,2,17,Lily: No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.
11410,39,2,17,"Barney: Aw, nerts."
11411,39,2,17,Ted: The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?
11412,39,2,17,"Marshall: Ah, the Fiero-asco."
11413,39,2,17,"Ted: Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco."
11414,39,2,17,Robin: What's the 100K fiasco?
11415,39,2,17,Marshall: The Fiero-asco?
11416,39,2,17,"Ted: It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet."
11417,39,2,17,Marshall: I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.
11418,39,2,17,Ted: And Marshall was a total slob.
11419,39,2,17,Flashback. College. Marshall comes in the room while Ted's on the bed reading.
11420,39,2,17,"Marshall: Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up."
11421,39,2,17,"Ted: All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so..."
11422,39,2,17,"Marshall: All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K."
11423,39,2,17,Ted: She'd be so bummed if I left early.
11424,39,2,17,In Marshall's car...
11425,39,2,17,"Ted: It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual."
11426,39,2,17,Marshall: I hear you.
11427,39,2,17,Ted: So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious
11428,39,2,17,"Marshall: Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?"
11429,39,2,17,Ted(voix off): The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.
11430,39,2,17,Ted: So... this song.
11431,39,2,17,"Marshall: Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though."
11432,39,2,17,Ted: Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.
11433,39,2,17,Marshall: Don't worry. It comes around again.
11434,39,2,17,Ted: What do you mean?
11435,39,2,17,"Ted and Marshall singing: Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door..."
11436,39,2,17,"Marshall: Yeah, we totally nailed the ending."
11437,39,2,17,"Ted: That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?"
11438,39,2,17,Marshall: What?
11439,39,2,17,"Ted: Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, ""Zitch dog."" I'm pretty good, so..."
11440,39,2,17,Marshall: Zitch dog.
11441,39,2,17,"Ted: Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point."
11442,39,2,17,Marshall: Zitch dog.
11443,39,2,17,Ted: Zitch dog. Damn it!
11444,39,2,17,Ted: Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...
11445,39,2,17,Marshall: 12-nothing.
11446,39,2,17,Marshall's sleeping and Ted driving.
11447,39,2,17,Ted: Marshall. Marshall.
11448,39,2,17,"Marshall: Zitch dog, blue Suburban."
11449,39,2,17,Ted: Damn it!
11450,39,2,17,Marshall: 18-nothing.
11451,39,2,17,"Ted (voix off): Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost."
11452,39,2,17,Marshall: Where the hell are we?!
11453,39,2,17,End of flashback. In the garage.
11454,39,2,17,"Marshall: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something."
11455,39,2,17,Barney: Really? Seems impossible.
11456,39,2,17,Flashback. Ted's driving the car...
11457,39,2,17,"Ted: Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost."
11458,39,2,17,Marshall: Doesn't seem like a smart idea.
11459,39,2,17,"Ted: Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?"
11460,39,2,17,Marshall: Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.
11461,39,2,17,"Ted: No, keep driving."
11462,39,2,17,"Marshall: We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore."
11463,39,2,17,"Ted: It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water."
11464,39,2,17,"Marshall: Nah, I threw them out."
11465,39,2,17,Ted: What?!
11466,39,2,17,Marshall: No food or drink in the Fiero.
11467,39,2,17,Ted: No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off): Thus began the longest night of our lives.
11468,39,2,17,Marshall: Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.
11469,39,2,17,"Ted: Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever."
11470,39,2,17,"Marshall: Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone."
11471,39,2,17,Ted: What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.
11472,39,2,17,"Marshall: Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out."
11473,39,2,17,"Ted: But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't."
11474,39,2,17,Marshall: Wasn't an easy decision.
11475,39,2,17,Ted: This is all because of your insane no-food rule.
11476,39,2,17,Marshall: It's perfectly rational.
11477,39,2,17,They start fighting.
11478,39,2,17,"Ted: Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?"
11479,39,2,17,Marshall: Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(they're both in the back seat in each other arms) We should've kept driving.
11480,39,2,17,"Ted: Come on, Marshall."
11481,39,2,17,"Marshall: No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles."
11482,39,2,17,"Ted: That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall."
11483,39,2,17,Marshall: Yeah?
11484,39,2,17,Ted: Are you still thinking about Lily?
11485,39,2,17,Marshall: Yeah.
11486,39,2,17,Ted: Please stop.(voix off) And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...
11487,39,2,17,
11488,39,2,17,Ted and Marshall are sleeping in the car which is next to a hotel. A man knocks onthe window.
11489,39,2,17,Man: Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.
11490,39,2,17,Marshall: Zitch dog!
11491,39,2,17,Ted: Damn it!
11492,39,2,17,End of flashback. In the garage...
11493,39,2,17,Lily: You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.
11494,39,2,17,Ted: That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.
11495,39,2,17,"Barney: With privileges, from the sound of it."
11496,39,2,17,Mechanic: Eriksen. (Marshall follows the mechanic)
11497,39,2,17,Barney: Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.
11498,39,2,17,"Marshall: He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee."
11499,39,2,17,"Ted: Well, it's a pretty old car."
11500,39,2,17,"Robin: Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point."
11501,39,2,17,"Marshall: I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit."
11502,39,2,17,Barney: How dare you...
11503,39,2,17,Robibn: Hey.
11504,39,2,17,Marshall: I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.
11505,39,2,17,Marshall are kissing in the car when a cat jumps in the roof.
11506,39,2,17,Marshall: Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.
11507,39,2,17,"Robin: Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all ""prisoner's dilemma"" on me."
11508,39,2,17,"Lily: The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience."
11509,39,2,17,"Marshall: Guys, what are you talking about?"
11510,39,2,17,"Lily: Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place."
11511,39,2,17,Flashback. In Ted's apartment...
11512,39,2,17,Robin: An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.
11513,39,2,17,"Lily: I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule."
11514,39,2,17,"Robin: But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran."
11515,39,2,17,"Lily: Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between ""affect"" and ""effect"" are the only two things he's really serious about."
11516,39,2,17,"Robin: Lily, it's gonna be fine."
11517,39,2,17,"Lily: No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!"
11518,39,2,17,"Robin: Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars."
11519,39,2,17,"Lily: There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them."
11520,39,2,17,"Robin: Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song."
11521,39,2,17,Lily: These cigars aren't helping at all.
11522,39,2,17,Robin: Yeah. This was a terrible idea.
11523,39,2,17,Lily: Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.
11524,39,2,17,Marshall: The broken windows?
11525,39,2,17,Lily: We had to make it look realistic.
11526,39,2,17,Marshall: Why did you break two of them?
11527,39,2,17,Robin: It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.
11528,39,2,17,Marshall: Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.
11529,39,2,17,"Lily: Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends."
11530,39,2,17,"Mechanic: Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?"
11531,39,2,17,Marshall: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
11532,39,2,17,"Barney: Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here."
11533,39,2,17,"Robin: Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?"
11534,39,2,17,Barney: Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!
11535,39,2,17,Lily: What? Why?
11536,39,2,17,Barney: Why? Why? Why?! Why?!
11537,39,2,17,Ted: Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.
11538,39,2,17,Flasback. Barney comes into Ted's apartment.
11539,39,2,17,Ted: Hey.
11540,39,2,17,"Barney: Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride."
11541,39,2,17,"Ted: Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys."
11542,39,2,17,Barney: Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.
11543,39,2,17,Ted: To Queens?
11544,39,2,17,"Barney: Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits."
11545,39,2,17,"Ted:Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so."
11546,39,2,17,"Barney: Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later."
11547,39,2,17,"Ted: Wait! You know how to drive, right?"
11548,39,2,17,"Barney: What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers."
11549,39,2,17,Ted: Which pedal's the gas?
11550,39,2,17,Barney: Trick question.
11551,39,2,17,"Ted: No, it's not"
11552,39,2,17,"Barney: Yes, it is."
11553,39,2,17,"Ted: No, it's not."
11554,39,2,17,"Barney: Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance."
11555,39,2,17,"Ted: Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up."
11556,39,2,17,Barney's driving and Ted's teaching him.
11557,39,2,17,Barney: This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.
11558,39,2,17,Ted: Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.
11559,39,2,17,"Barney: Dude, a dog."
11560,39,2,17,"Ted: Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing."
11561,39,2,17,"Barney: What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted."
11562,39,2,17,Ted: Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
11563,39,2,17,Barney: Which? Which one's the break again?
11564,39,2,17,Ted: The left one.
11565,39,2,17,"Barney: Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking."
11566,39,2,17,Ted: Make the Ls
11567,39,2,17,".Barney: Oh, we're not going to make it."
11568,39,2,17,Ted: Why did you just turn on the radio?
11569,39,2,17,"Barney: I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted."
11570,39,2,17,Ted: Relax. You're being crazy.
11571,39,2,17,"Barney: Help me, Ted! I'm being serious."
11572,39,2,17,"Ted: Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!"
11573,39,2,17,Barney: I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.
11574,39,2,17,Ted: We're okay.
11575,39,2,17,"Barney: We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!"
11576,39,2,17,End of flaxhback.
11577,39,2,17,Robin: Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.
11578,39,2,17,"Ted: Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he..."
11579,39,2,17,"Barney: ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest."
11580,39,2,17,Lily: So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.
11581,39,2,17,Barney: True story.
11582,39,2,17,Marshall: Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.
11583,39,2,17,Barney: Yes!
11584,39,2,17,Ted and Robin: What?
11585,39,2,17,"Marshall: It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted: But 200,000..."
11586,39,2,17,"Marshall: But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember."
11587,39,2,17,Lily: That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.
11588,39,2,17,Marshall: I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.
11589,39,2,17,"Ted: You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives."
11590,39,2,17,Marshall: Affected.
11591,39,2,17,Ted: That's what I said.
11592,39,2,17,"Marshall: Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push."
11593,39,2,17,"Maechanic: Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere."
11594,39,2,17,Marshall: Close enough!
11595,39,2,17,All: Close enough!
11596,39,2,17,"Ted (voix off): And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights."
11597,39,2,17,At the bar...
11598,39,2,17,"Marshall: Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace."
11599,39,2,17,"Barney: Rot in hell, devil steed."
11600,39,2,17,Ted (voix off): And what better friend is there than that?
11601,39,2,17,Flashback. Marshall and his brother are in the Fiero.
11602,39,2,17,Marshall: Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.
11603,39,2,17,Brother: Put it in.
11604,40,2,18,"Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything was great between me and Robin."
11605,40,2,18,So we decided to try and make it even better.
11606,40,2,18,We decided to move in together.
11607,40,2,18,"So, I can have the moving truck here by 8:00 am."
11608,40,2,18,Does that sound good to everybody?
11609,40,2,18,"By the way, what are you guys doing with Ted's room?"
11610,40,2,18,"'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it."
11611,40,2,18,Why would you want to live with us?
11612,40,2,18,"I don't call what you guys do ""living."""
11613,40,2,18,"Here's the deal, I need a room closer to the bar."
11614,40,2,18,It takes me exactly 23 minutes to get a girl from the bar back to my apartment.
11615,40,2,18,A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes.
11616,40,2,18,This is going to be so hot.
11617,40,2,18,She's paying.
11618,40,2,18,"I swear, if he doesn't call me back, I'm going to go through with this."
11619,40,2,18,"Please hurry, sir."
11620,40,2,18,I want to do dirty stuff with you.
11621,40,2,18,Stuff I won't let him do.
11622,40,2,18,Every red light run is an extra $20.
11623,40,2,18,Baby?
11624,40,2,18,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was all my fault."
11625,40,2,18,I am so drunk.
11626,40,2,18,"When I'm this drunk, I go crazy!"
11627,40,2,18,I bet you do.
11628,40,2,18,Check this out.
11629,40,2,18,What up NYPD?
11630,40,2,18,So close.
11631,40,2,18,See? If I had a room here all I have to do is get them upstairs.
11632,40,2,18,"Come on, guys. It'll be great!"
11633,40,2,18,We'll come in after you guys are asleep and I'll be gone before you wake up.
11634,40,2,18,"So, you get to have s*x and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning and kick her out?"
11635,40,2,18,"God, Lily."
11636,40,2,18,Some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom and never came back you can't make her a cup of coffee?
11637,40,2,18,Real nice.
11638,40,2,18,"I put all your heavy jackets in this box marked ""winter."""
11639,40,2,18,"And all your colorful sweaters in this box marked ""Bill Cosby."""
11640,40,2,18,"Make fun, but America loved that guy for a reason."
11641,40,2,18,Wow!
11642,40,2,18,Almost done.
11643,40,2,18,Not so fast.
11644,40,2,18,Take your sword.
11645,40,2,18,Wow.
11646,40,2,18,End of an era.
11647,40,2,18,Yeah.
11648,40,2,18,"It's a bummer to break up the set, but you're going to need that sword."
11649,40,2,18,It's true... my building is infested with dragons.
11650,40,2,18,Looks like our little boy is finally moving out.
11651,40,2,18,It seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen.
11652,40,2,18,Discovering Reggae and ultimate Frisbee.
11653,40,2,18,He did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him.
11654,40,2,18,We knew he'd get there.
11655,40,2,18,"You haven't moved in yet, have you?"
11656,40,2,18,Good. You guys have to take this quiz.
11657,40,2,18,I found it in a magazine.
11658,40,2,18,"It's called the ""Are you ready to move in together?"" quiz."
11659,40,2,18,"Well, if it's anything like you're ""Are you wearing panties"" quiz, I'm out."
11660,40,2,18,"Question one, Ted, ""Do you want to move in with Robin?"""
11661,40,2,18,Mm. Yes.
11662,40,2,18,"Oh, you got the first one wrong."
11663,40,2,18,"The answer is ""no,"" you secretly want to be single and hang out with your awesome friend Barney."""
11664,40,2,18,Question two.
11665,40,2,18,"Robin, ""Do you think you can score a hotter guy than Ted?"""
11666,40,2,18,Correct. The answer was awkward silence.
11667,40,2,18,"Question three, ""Did I just make up this quiz to prove a point?"""
11668,40,2,18,Yes.
11669,40,2,18,"Yes, I did."
11670,40,2,18,Really? You mean it's not from Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?
11671,40,2,18,So? We all agree?
11672,40,2,18,We move Ted's stuff back up here?
11673,40,2,18,Mm... no. We're still moving in together.
11674,40,2,18,Why? This is crazy.
11675,40,2,18,Ted you're throwing your life away. This girl is blinding you.
11676,40,2,18,With her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs.
11677,40,2,18,"This is bad for you, too, you know."
11678,40,2,18,How are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup?
11679,40,2,18,I'm not wearing makeup right now.
11680,40,2,18,"Holy crap, you're beautiful."
11681,40,2,18,"All right then, how will you feel when you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?"
11682,40,2,18,"Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke."
11683,40,2,18,"Wait, do you?"
11684,40,2,18,Of course not. Why?
11685,40,2,18,Don't tell me how to live my life!
11686,40,2,18,"Ted, I can't let you do this."
11687,40,2,18,Come on. This is happening.
11688,40,2,18,"So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help?"
11689,40,2,18,You want me to help you?
11690,40,2,18,Yeah.
11691,40,2,18,"Okay, Ted."
11692,40,2,18,I'll help you.
11693,40,2,18,Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down.
11694,40,2,18,Maybe he's finally getting on board.
11695,40,2,18,Where's the truck?
11696,40,2,18,Where's Barney?
11697,40,2,18,Wait for it.
11698,40,2,18,I can't believe this! Everything I own in the world is in there.
11699,40,2,18,Except for this box of pot lids.
11700,40,2,18,And the sword.
11701,40,2,18,I'm going to kill him. I swear to God I'm going to kill him!
11702,40,2,18,Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that. For now.
11703,40,2,18,"Marshall, we live alone."
11704,40,2,18,This is so great!
11705,40,2,18,We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.
11706,40,2,18,"Oh, I know what I want to start with."
11707,40,2,18,"So, here we are, right?"
11708,40,2,18,Sitting around the apartment naked.
11709,40,2,18,Awesome.
11710,40,2,18,Yep.
11711,40,2,18,It's not as awesome as I thought it would be.
11712,40,2,18,My butt itches.
11713,40,2,18,I'm cold.
11714,40,2,18,I noticed.
11715,40,2,18,"Yeah, like you're one to talk, Pointy."
11716,40,2,18,"Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages, but if my stuff isn't here within the hour I'm calling the cops."
11717,40,2,18,This is the last time I'm calling you.
11718,40,2,18,Because my charger's in the back of the truck.
11719,40,2,18,"Don't worry, it's Barney. He'll bring the stuff back."
11720,40,2,18,"No, it's just... I was really looking forward to settling in, you know?"
11721,40,2,18,Maybe setting up my TV.
11722,40,2,18,Watching a movie in bed.
11723,40,2,18,What?
11724,40,2,18,Do we really want a TV in the bedroom?
11725,40,2,18,I thought we did.
11726,40,2,18,I'm not sure that we do.
11727,40,2,18,"Well, where else would we put my TV?"
11728,40,2,18,We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.
11729,40,2,18,But wouldn't we miss my TV?
11730,40,2,18,Would we?
11731,40,2,18,"Yes, we would."
11732,40,2,18,We've had that TV for a long time and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom.
11733,40,2,18,"We need wine, don't we?"
11734,40,2,18,"Yes, we do."
11735,40,2,18,"Should we, um, move this to the bedroom?"
11736,40,2,18,Why?
11737,40,2,18,Ted doesn't live here anymore.
11738,40,2,18,We can do it wherever we want.
11739,40,2,18,You know what else?
11740,40,2,18,We don't have to be quiet anymore.
11741,40,2,18,We can be as loud as we want.
11742,40,2,18,"Okay, I think we need to lay down some ground rules."
11743,40,2,18,Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud.
11744,40,2,18,"And although it might turn you on, you screaming, ""I'm the best,"" doesn't do much for me."
11745,40,2,18,"Well, it's a lot better than yelling, ""Ted's not here,"" over and over again."
11746,40,2,18,"Well, at least what I said is true."
11747,40,2,18,"Well, that was unnecessary."
11748,40,2,18,"Well, since I only have one box I figure I might as well unpack it."
11749,40,2,18,"Mm, where do you think we should put it?"
11750,40,2,18,"Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room, I was thinking the cupboard."
11751,40,2,18,What?
11752,40,2,18,"Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small."
11753,40,2,18,"And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids and mine come with pots, so..."
11754,40,2,18,You're saying there's no way to make room for the single box of stuff I try to move into our place?
11755,40,2,18,"Well, why don't you just take it down to the..."
11756,40,2,18,Do not say storage space.
11757,40,2,18,I was going to say Dumpster.
11758,40,2,18,"Damn it, Robin, this is all I have left in the world--"
11759,40,2,18,eight pot lids and a sword.
11760,40,2,18,"Yeah, about the sword."
11761,40,2,18,Hello.
11762,40,2,18,"Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby."
11763,40,2,18,"Barney, I know it's you. Where's my stuff?"
11764,40,2,18,It's not me.
11765,40,2,18,"If you want to see your precious possessions again, put on the suit."
11766,40,2,18,What suit?
11767,40,2,18,"Ding-dong. Oh, what's that? The doorbell."
11768,40,2,18,That's the suit I'm talking about.
11769,40,2,18,I haven't gotten to the door yet.
11770,40,2,18,"Oh, okay, let me know when you get there."
11771,40,2,18,"Okay, I opened it. And there's a suit there."
11772,40,2,18,That's the suit I'm talking about.
11773,40,2,18,Barney....
11774,40,2,18,This isn't Barney.
11775,40,2,18,But I hear that guy's awesome.
11776,40,2,18,All right. Listen very carefully.
11777,40,2,18,You will get your stuff back if you are able to complete a series of challenges.
11778,40,2,18,"Number one, put on the suit."
11779,40,2,18,"Number two, meet me at McClaren's in an hour."
11780,40,2,18,How will I know who to look for since we've never met?
11781,40,2,18,I look like Barney.
11782,40,2,18,"Oh, hey, Ted."
11783,40,2,18,Suit and sneakers.
11784,40,2,18,A little Ellen DeGeneres but you pull it off.
11785,40,2,18,I don't have any other shoes because you stole them along with everything else I own in the world.
11786,40,2,18,"Where's the truck, Barney?"
11787,40,2,18,Barney.
11788,40,2,18,People's whose trucks I'm not holding for ransom call me Barney.
11789,40,2,18,I think you should call me The Commodore.
11790,40,2,18,I'm not calling you...
11791,40,2,18,You're not getting your stuff back.
11792,40,2,18,Can I please have my stuff back...
11793,40,2,18,The Commodore?
11794,40,2,18,No.
11795,40,2,18,"Here's the deal, Ted, you're my bro."
11796,40,2,18,"And you're about to become a henpecked, beaten down, shell of a man."
11797,40,2,18,"So tonight, we are going to have one last awesome night together as bros."
11798,40,2,18,It's a bro-ing away party.
11799,40,2,18,A special bro-casion.
11800,40,2,18,A bro-choice rally.
11801,40,2,18,Bro-time at the Apollo.
11802,40,2,18,"Oh, bro me."
11803,40,2,18,"Well, so what do I have to do?"
11804,40,2,18,"No, it's not what you have to do, it's what you want to do, and you want to have a good time before you go take Fun Ted out back and shoot him."
11805,40,2,18,So... first thing on the docket... get me that girl's number.
11806,40,2,18,Absolutely not.
11807,40,2,18,Mm. That's too bad.
11808,40,2,18,"Hey, hypothetical question: if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?"
11809,40,2,18,"Hey, look, world's strongest man is on."
11810,40,2,18,"Ooh, it's the one where Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus from the Partridge family with his teeth."
11811,40,2,18,"It's the best one. Hey, Ted, get in..."
11812,40,2,18,We live alone.
11813,40,2,18,Yay.
11814,40,2,18,"Well, I win."
11815,40,2,18,
11816,40,2,18,You need to give my friend your phone number.
11817,40,2,18,"Wow, I really didn't think Lou Ferrigno could pull that bus."
11818,40,2,18,Are you sure this is live? It looks pretty old.
11819,40,2,18,"Yeah, that's 'cause the, uh, TV is old."
11820,40,2,18,"So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow?"
11821,40,2,18,"Yeah. Um, not too early. I have church."
11822,40,2,18,"You were impressive, buddy."
11823,40,2,18,"Nice work. All right, next challenge."
11824,40,2,18,"No. No next challenge. Look, this is my first night living with Robin."
11825,40,2,18,She's probably pissed I'm spending it out with you.
11826,40,2,18,"This might be our last hurrah, my little friend."
11827,40,2,18,"Marshall, I am gonna cook you the best dinner of your life."
11828,40,2,18,How would you like a... one-egg omelet with some ketchup and film?
11829,40,2,18,Guess Ted's the one who did the shopping.
11830,40,2,18,"Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!"
11831,40,2,18,"Guess the microwave was Ted's, too."
11832,40,2,18,Yeah.
11833,40,2,18,So were all the towels.
11834,40,2,18,Turns out that everything that was useful in this apartment was Ted's.
11835,40,2,18,Everything that was a Foghat poster we bought ironically in college was mine.
11836,40,2,18,Marshall.
11837,40,2,18,"Yeah, baby?"
11838,40,2,18,I miss Ted.
11839,40,2,18,Is it too soon to call him?
11840,40,2,18,"No, we shouldn't."
11841,40,2,18,I don't want to interrupt his first night living with Robin.
11842,40,2,18,"Ha, nice shooting."
11843,40,2,18,"You know, if we win this one it's free onion rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack."
11844,40,2,18,What a bargain.
11845,40,2,18,We only had to spend 20 bucks a game.
11846,40,2,18,"Admit it, you're having fun."
11847,40,2,18,Maybe.
11848,40,2,18,"I mean, it was pretty funny when that little girl fell over that space barrel."
11849,40,2,18,Nice... We win.
11850,40,2,18,"Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--"
11851,40,2,18,what up?
11852,40,2,18,Okay. Let's go one more.
11853,40,2,18,I don't know.
11854,40,2,18,You know you want to.
11855,40,2,18,"All right, let's do it... I just got to call Robin real quick."
11856,40,2,18,"Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on?"
11857,40,2,18,"No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady and ask permission to have fun."
11858,40,2,18,"Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating our victory onion rings Han style."
11859,40,2,18,Solo.
11860,40,2,18,"Hey, Ted."
11861,40,2,18,"Hey, sweetie listen, I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up."
11862,40,2,18,"Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do."
11863,40,2,18,Thanks. You're the best. I love you.
11864,40,2,18,"I love you, too. Bye."
11865,40,2,18,"Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding."
11866,40,2,18,"Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription to Guns and Ammo, that would be great."
11867,40,2,18,"No, it's a great magazine. Really great."
11868,40,2,18,They've printed three of my letters.
11869,40,2,18,It's just that my boyfriend is moving in and he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing.
11870,40,2,18,A free hand grenade phone?
11871,40,2,18,You know what? Let me give you my work address.
11872,40,2,18,"I did it, baby!"
11873,40,2,18,I got beer. I got food.
11874,40,2,18,We don't need Ted anymore.
11875,40,2,18,"I am the provider of this apartment now, and I have provided!"
11876,40,2,18,"""Provode""? Provided."
11877,40,2,18,"Anyway, I got us everything we need."
11878,40,2,18,Could you toss me the toilet paper?
11879,40,2,18,"Be right back, baby. Sit tight."
11880,40,2,18,"Hey, I got to admit, um... I didn't think I would, but, uh..."
11881,40,2,18,I had a really good time tonight.
11882,40,2,18,"You're a good friend, Barney."
11883,40,2,18,"Hey, man, why don't you, uh... why don't you tell me where my truck is."
11884,40,2,18,"No, I don't think so."
11885,40,2,18,Where's my truck?!
11886,40,2,18,Do you know why I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet?
11887,40,2,18,"Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk of the British Royal Douchery?"
11888,40,2,18,Because you don't want them back.
11889,40,2,18,"You could've left at any time tonight, but you didn't, Ted."
11890,40,2,18,Why is that?
11891,40,2,18,Because I didn't want to go back to Robin's without my stuff.
11892,40,2,18,False. You know what I think?
11893,40,2,18,I think you spent one day with her and it already sucked.
11894,40,2,18,"I think you didn't like being there, she didn't like having you there and you both realized that you made a huge mistake."
11895,40,2,18,And that's why you spent your first night living with Robin out playing laser tag with me.
11896,40,2,18,"And that's why three seconds ago you didn't call it ""my place"" or ""our place"" or ""home,"" you called it ""Robin's."""
11897,40,2,18,You know what?
11898,40,2,18,You can keep my stuff.
11899,40,2,18,Hey.
11900,40,2,18,"Hey, did you get the truck back?"
11901,40,2,18,No.
11902,40,2,18,Why not? What happened?
11903,40,2,18,"Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left."
11904,40,2,18,"Anyway, I just wanted to come back here, space out and watch a movie."
11905,40,2,18,Do you anything that wasn't made by John Woo?
11906,40,2,18,"Why, do you?"
11907,40,2,18,"You know, forget the movie. I just want to sit."
11908,40,2,18,What?
11909,40,2,18,It's just I eat at that table.
11910,40,2,18,"Fine, I'll take my shoes off."
11911,40,2,18,"You know, why don't you just throw me down in the storage space where you have room for me."
11912,40,2,18,"Ted, come on."
11913,40,2,18,"No, you come on."
11914,40,2,18,I had to jump through hoops all night for Barney and then it took me an hour to get home because his place is so far away from the bar.
11915,40,2,18,"Oh, my God."
11916,40,2,18,What?
11917,40,2,18,I know where Barney put my truck.
11918,40,2,18,Let's go back to my place.
11919,40,2,18,I bet you my place is closer.
11920,40,2,18,Here we are.
11921,40,2,18,You live in the loading dock behind the bar?
11922,40,2,18,"I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride."
11923,40,2,18,"No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van, I've seen Silence of the Lambs."
11924,40,2,18,"Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van."
11925,40,2,18,"Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are."
11926,40,2,18,Those other Rockettes who called you slow are crazy.
11927,40,2,18,"Oh, my God. I knew it. You're kidnapping me."
11928,40,2,18,Help! Help!
11929,40,2,18,"No, no, no, no."
11930,40,2,18,I can explain.
11931,40,2,18,Hello?
11932,40,2,18,Enjoying the ride?
11933,40,2,18,"Ted? Ted, you let us out of here. You let us out of here this instant!"
11934,40,2,18,This isn't Ted.
11935,40,2,18,But I hear that guy's awesome.
11936,40,2,18,So I took Sara home and I took Barney to a bar near his apartment.
11937,40,2,18,"Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him."
11938,40,2,18,That poor girl must've been so confused.
11939,40,2,18,Yeah.
11940,40,2,18,"Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson."
11941,40,2,18,You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette.
11942,40,2,18,"So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked."
11943,40,2,18,Yeah.
11944,40,2,18,"Yeah, I guess we should."
11945,40,2,18,"Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest, there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree."
11946,40,2,18,It cannot survive without this tree.
11947,40,2,18,It is supported... by this tree.
11948,40,2,18,"Lily, we are that tree."
11949,40,2,18,The inside tree or the outside tree?
11950,40,2,18,The outside tree.
11951,40,2,18,Shouldn't there be three trees?
11952,40,2,18,You and I are one tree.
11953,40,2,18,"Okay, look, Lily, the point is that we grew around Ted and without him, we're slowly dying."
11954,40,2,18,What do we do?
11955,40,2,18,I think we can marry each other.
11956,40,2,18,But we also have to marry Ted.
11957,40,2,18,"I'll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for that wedding."
11958,40,2,18,Ted!
11959,40,2,18,What are you doing here?
11960,40,2,18,Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all.
11961,40,2,18,What happened?
11962,40,2,18,I thought we decided we were ready?
11963,40,2,18,I know.
11964,40,2,18,How did we come to that again?
11965,40,2,18,I don't remember. We were fighting?
11966,40,2,18,It's all so blurry.
11967,40,2,18,Yeah.
11968,40,2,18,"The ""let's move in together"" s*x was pretty amazing."
11969,40,2,18,I know.
11970,40,2,18,I did that thing with no hands I normally need both to do.
11971,40,2,18,You know... I'm really happy with you.
11972,40,2,18,I really happy with you. The way things are.
11973,40,2,18,Maybe we shouldn't mess with that.
11974,40,2,18,I don't know that we should.
11975,40,2,18,"Hey... I hear the ""let's not move in together"" s*x is pretty incredible."
11976,40,2,18,Let's go back to my place.
11977,40,2,18,"Ooh, thank you."
11978,40,2,18,You're welcome.
11979,40,2,18,"No, thank you."
11980,40,2,18,You'll be very happy.
11981,40,2,18,"Look, I know you guys are really excited about having the place to yourself."
11982,40,2,18,"Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not too much of an imposition..."
11983,40,2,18,"God, this feels so right."
11984,40,2,18,Never leave us again.
11985,40,2,18,"Guys, Robin's down in the truck and there's actually a lot of boxes, so maybe we should..."
11986,40,2,18,Do we have time for this?
11987,40,2,18,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list."
11988,40,2,18,The category: top ten things I would've called my truck...
11989,40,2,18,It was never your truck.
11990,40,2,18,...if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back.
11991,40,2,18,It was a rental.
11992,40,2,18,"Number ten, ""The Winne-Bango."""
11993,40,2,18,"Number nine, ""The Pick-Up Truck."""
11994,40,2,18,"Number eight, ""The Ford Explore Her."""
11995,40,2,18,"Number seven, ""The You Scream Truck."""
11996,40,2,18,You Scream.
11997,40,2,18,"Number six, ""Feels On Wheels."" Hello!"
11998,40,2,18,"Number five, ""The Ride Her Truck."""
11999,40,2,18,"Number four, ""The 18-Squeeler."""
12000,40,2,18,"Number three, ""The Esca-Laid."""
12001,40,2,18,"Number two, ""The Slam-Boney."" and... the number one thing I would've called my truck if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back..."
12002,40,2,18,"""The '69 Chevy."""
12003,41,2,19,It took me a while to figure out but the key to understanding your Uncle Barney is this.
12004,41,2,19,"When times are hard, it's impossible to keep him around."
12005,41,2,19,Like when your aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were broken up.
12006,41,2,19,Hey. What are you guys talking about?
12007,41,2,19,Lily.
12008,41,2,19,I got to go.
12009,41,2,19,"But when times are good, it's impossible to get rid of him."
12010,41,2,19,What are you guys doing?
12011,41,2,19,We just finished planning Marshall's bachelor party.
12012,41,2,19,"Good, you haven't started yet. Let's talk logistics."
12013,41,2,19,"Now, have you laid out ground rules with Lily?"
12014,41,2,19,Where you are or aren't allowed to touch or be touched?
12015,41,2,19,Show me on Ted.
12016,41,2,19,"Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking of skipping the strippers."
12017,41,2,19,You... you want to have a party without strippers.
12018,41,2,19,This was the worse thing I could have said.
12019,41,2,19,"You see, uncle Barney loved cooking up bachelor parties."
12020,41,2,19,And it was always the same recipe.
12021,41,2,19,You start with a slightly cramped hotel suite.
12022,41,2,19,Arrange the chairs in a circle...
12023,41,2,19,Fill them with your closest friends.
12024,41,2,19,Turn the heat up to about 90.
12025,41,2,19,Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.
12026,41,2,19,"And then, right in the middle of the room, you throw in a girl."
12027,41,2,19,"But not a beautiful girl... no, if this girl was ever beautiful, it was two kids, three tattoos and one pesky substance abuse problem ago."
12028,41,2,19,Which one of you is Stuart?
12029,41,2,19,"Please, I really don't want to do this."
12030,41,2,19,"Shut up, put in your mouth guard."
12031,41,2,19,"Then she proceeds to do things that demean the groom, herself and really, the entire human race."
12032,41,2,19,Disgusting.
12033,41,2,19,"Ah, horrifying."
12034,41,2,19,Classic.
12035,41,2,19,"Oh, please, please, no, no."
12036,41,2,19,I don't want anything like that happening to me.
12037,41,2,19,Stuart's still trying to forget that night.
12038,41,2,19,It's my bachelor party. We're not having strippers.
12039,41,2,19,"Oh, he thinks he has a sain it."
12040,41,2,19,"So, strippers it is!"
12041,41,2,19,"Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going to be and I'll make some calls."
12042,41,2,19,"Barney, there is..."
12043,41,2,19,"Before you say no, it has attachments."
12044,41,2,19,"Look, I know you have some stuff planned for Marshall's bachelor party, but he really doesn't want strippers."
12045,41,2,19,"Yes, he does."
12046,41,2,19,"Uh, well, he told me he doesn't."
12047,41,2,19,"Uh, well, he told me he does."
12048,41,2,19,When?
12049,41,2,19,Every minute of every day as his inner animal thrashes against the cage of his own puritanical upbringing.
12050,41,2,19,Or do you guys not like naked girls.
12051,41,2,19,"Um, we love naked girls."
12052,41,2,19,They're one of the best things in the world.
12053,41,2,19,"It goes... naked girls, democracy, the scene in Every Which Way But Loose where the monkey gives a guy the finger."
12054,41,2,19,We just don't like your naked girls.
12055,41,2,19,"What, my girls aren't hot enough?"
12056,41,2,19,"I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at Stuart's bachelor party was a 15."
12057,41,2,19,She was 15?
12058,41,2,19,"No, a 15. Like in blackjack."
12059,41,2,19,"As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?"
12060,41,2,19,Exactly.
12061,41,2,19,Nice.
12062,41,2,19,"This is important to Marshall. So, promise me, no strippers."
12063,41,2,19,"All right, I promise."
12064,41,2,19,I'm serious.
12065,41,2,19,So am I. No strippers.
12066,41,2,19,Now say it without winking.
12067,41,2,19,No strippers.
12068,41,2,19,You just winked.
12069,41,2,19,No I didn't.
12070,41,2,19,"So, when the day arrived, we all climbed into a rented Escalade and set out."
12071,41,2,19,"Now, every bachelor party is usually made up of the same stock characters."
12072,41,2,19,You've got the groom... the best man... the guy who speaks only in clichés...
12073,41,2,19,Dead man walking!
12074,41,2,19,...the guy who disappears at the beginning of the night and doesn't show up again until the end.
12075,41,2,19,"All right, who's up for a little blackjack before we check in."
12076,41,2,19,"No, no, no."
12077,41,2,19,None for me.
12078,41,2,19,"See you guys back at the room, then."
12079,41,2,19,"And, of course, well... Barney."
12080,41,2,19,"Every bachelor party has a Barney. Oh, what's this?"
12081,41,2,19,"This car has a DVD player? You mean, we could have been watching these pornos the whole time?"
12082,41,2,19,Yeah.
12083,41,2,19,This one's in HD.
12084,41,2,19,This one's in H-double-D. Oh!
12085,41,2,19,"That same night, aunt Lily was having a wedding shower."
12086,41,2,19,And Robin showed up gift in hand.
12087,41,2,19,Funny story about that gift.
12088,41,2,19,"Hey, Barney, check out what I got Lily for her shower."
12089,41,2,19,It's kind of racy. Think you can handle it?
12090,41,2,19,"Uh, I've been in a ten-way. So, yeah."
12091,41,2,19,It's kind of see-through.
12092,41,2,19,"Whoa, ho ho!"
12093,41,2,19,You weren't kidding! You know when you should give that to her?
12094,41,2,19,1850
12095,41,2,19,"Robin, it's her bridal shower!"
12096,41,2,19,"All her friends are gonna be there, they're going to be drinking."
12097,41,2,19,"You need to get her something daring, something outrageous."
12098,41,2,19,"Well, what do you think I should get her?"
12099,41,2,19,There's a store on Eighth Avenue that specializes in--
12100,41,2,19,how to put this delicately?--
12101,41,2,19,"uh, battery-powered, adult-"
12102,41,2,19,recreational fake penises.
12103,41,2,19,"And so Aunt Robin went to a store on Eighth Avenue, and a battery-powered, adult-recreational..."
12104,41,2,19,"Well, it was something inappropriate. And we're back in."
12105,41,2,19,Robin!
12106,41,2,19,I'm so glad you're here.
12107,41,2,19,"Come in, I want you to meet everybody."
12108,41,2,19,"Robin, this is my Grandma Lois and my Aunt Florence."
12109,41,2,19,"Oh, lovely to meet you, dear."
12110,41,2,19,They put this whole party together.
12111,41,2,19,"It's different from what I expected, but lovely."
12112,41,2,19,Lovely.
12113,41,2,19,"And oh, look, there are little kids here!"
12114,41,2,19,"Yeah, my cousins."
12115,41,2,19,"Listen, I, uh, I forgot something somewhere so I'm going to just go..."
12116,41,2,19,"Robin, this is my mom, Janice."
12117,41,2,19,"Oh, honey. I'm so glad to finally meet you."
12118,41,2,19,"Me too. I, I've heard so much about you."
12119,41,2,19,"Me, too. Oh, here. Let me take your gift."
12120,41,2,19,"Can I guess what it is? Is it a, a, a mini food processor?"
12121,41,2,19,No.
12122,41,2,19,No? Oh.
12123,41,2,19,"Oh, give me a hint. What color is it?"
12124,41,2,19,Black.
12125,41,2,19,"Well, I guess I'm just going to have to wait and see!"
12126,41,2,19,"Oh, great."
12127,41,2,19,Robin...
12128,41,2,19,this is my Cousin Margaret.
12129,41,2,19,"Oh, finally, someone our own age!"
12130,41,2,19,"Wait, do I introduce you as ""Cousin Margaret"" or ""Sister Margaret?"""
12131,41,2,19,"Well, I'm not officially confirmed as a nun until next month and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy, so let's stick with ""Cousin"" for now."
12132,41,2,19,God's watching. Excellent!
12133,41,2,19,"Man, they spent a lot of money on this porno."
12134,41,2,19,"Whoa-- Morgan Freeman? Man, that guy's in everything."
12135,41,2,19,"Aw, man, I grabbed the wrong Deep Impact!"
12136,41,2,19,"No, leave it in, it's a good movie."
12137,41,2,19,"But, dude, there's no s*x in it."
12138,41,2,19,"Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right?"
12139,41,2,19,"Oh, oh, hey, check this out! Don't ask how, but I procured for us five loco-bueno, hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans."
12140,41,2,19,"Seriously, you could go to jail for smoking these things."
12141,41,2,19,"Marriage is like jail! Right, fellas?!"
12142,41,2,19,"But at least in jail, you get to have s*x!"
12143,41,2,19,"But we're not lighting these babies up, till we get to the A.C."
12144,41,2,19,A.C.?
12145,41,2,19,"Um, Atlantic City. Try to keep up, Brad."
12146,41,2,19,We're not going to Atlantic City.
12147,41,2,19,"Just a second, Brad."
12148,41,2,19,Hi.
12149,41,2,19,Hi.
12150,41,2,19,"We're still going to Atlantic City, right?"
12151,41,2,19,"Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we switched it. We're going to Foxwoods."
12152,41,2,19,Foxwoods?
12153,41,2,19,But I've got an ipperstray waiting in tlanticaay itycay.
12154,41,2,19,What the heck's in Foxwoods?
12155,41,2,19,"Well, we've got five third row seats to the Popinski-Salazar rematch."
12156,41,2,19,"They've set aside our very own craps table, and I reserved a private room for us at Connelly's, where the five of us are going to be sharing a 102-ounce steak from a cow that I picked out on the Internet."
12157,41,2,19,Yeah.
12158,41,2,19,Great. The night's ruined.
12159,41,2,19,"Sorry, Barney. It was an honest mistake."
12160,41,2,19,This is going to be great!
12161,41,2,19,"Meat, violence, throwing money down the toilet."
12162,41,2,19,America-- one; every other country-- zero.
12163,41,2,19,"Thanks, guys."
12164,41,2,19,Yeah.
12165,41,2,19,"You okay, Barney?"
12166,41,2,19,"What can I say, Ted? You won."
12167,41,2,19,Hi.
12168,41,2,19,"You one... sad, pathetic loser."
12169,41,2,19,"Boys, say hello to Treasure."
12170,41,2,19,"Hi, Treasure."
12171,41,2,19,I can't believe that you did this.
12172,41,2,19,I had to.
12173,41,2,19,I'm your best man.
12174,41,2,19,Ted's my best man.
12175,41,2,19,You've yet to make a decision and that's fine.
12176,41,2,19,"But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job to make sure at your bachelor party you see a woman take her clothes off while dancing to Whitesnake's ""Here I Go Again."""
12177,41,2,19,"All right, fine, but... let's make it fast, all right."
12178,41,2,19,The fight starts in an hour we don't want to miss it.
12179,41,2,19,It's a girl taking her clothes off. How long can it take?
12180,41,2,19,It's a bit more complicated than that.
12181,41,2,19,"I need two grounded sockets, a large sterile pot filled with hot water and you all need to sign these releases."
12182,41,2,19,"An egg beater! Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia!"
12183,41,2,19,I love that it's cordless.
12184,41,2,19,"Well, at least I got that part right."
12185,41,2,19,All of these gifts are so thoughtful.
12186,41,2,19,Lily?
12187,41,2,19,I need you to look at me right now and read my mind.
12188,41,2,19,"Oh, my God! You're hearing me!"
12189,41,2,19,Yeah!
12190,41,2,19,Sorry this party's so boring. What's up?
12191,41,2,19,Do not open my gift. See what I'm doing here?
12192,41,2,19,"I'm looking over at the gift, then back at you, and I'm shaking my head, ""no."""
12193,41,2,19,Gift. You. No.
12194,41,2,19,Are you getting that?
12195,41,2,19,I totally got it.
12196,41,2,19,
12197,41,2,19,Here you go.
12198,41,2,19,Lily said it was your time of the month.
12199,41,2,19,You're welcome.
12200,41,2,19,What are you doing?
12201,41,2,19,"Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts. The pile looked a bit precarious. So..."
12202,41,2,19,"Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it."
12203,41,2,19,Great. You do that.
12204,41,2,19,You're gonna make a damn good nun.
12205,41,2,19,"As many times as Robin told this story over the years, she would never quite be able to explain the logic of her next move."
12206,41,2,19,Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert?
12207,41,2,19,Shh! She's starting.
12208,41,2,19,"Please turn off your cell phones, pagers and sense of shame."
12209,41,2,19,"All right, boys. Lie back, get comfortable, and enjoy the show."
12210,41,2,19,Of course there's no way I'm telling you about her show.
12211,41,2,19,"So, let's skip ahead a little."
12212,41,2,19,Ow!
12213,41,2,19,"Oh my God, are you all right?"
12214,41,2,19,"No, I am not all right, you idiot. My ankle is broken!"
12215,41,2,19,Take me to the hospital!
12216,41,2,19,"Um, actually, we have tickets."
12217,41,2,19,"You know what? Thanks a lot, Barney."
12218,41,2,19,She told you at the beginning of the show not to use the smoke machine when she's on the hippity hop.
12219,41,2,19,Now I'm going to have to spend the rest of my bachelor party in a hospital.
12220,41,2,19,"Well, hey, maybe we'll get to see her X-rays."
12221,41,2,19,The ultimate strip show.
12222,41,2,19,X-rays. More like triple X-rays.
12223,41,2,19,Just stop.
12224,41,2,19,Which exit is the hospital?
12225,41,2,19,What if she doesn't make it to the hospital?
12226,41,2,19,"Barney, please calm down."
12227,41,2,19,"Maybe we should just take her to the desert, bury her and wash our hands of this whole thing!"
12228,41,2,19,"Dude, what is the matter with you?"
12229,41,2,19,I'm just trying to illustrate to Marshall that as his best man...
12230,41,2,19,You're not my best man.
12231,41,2,19,"As his best man, I would help him bury a hooker in the desert."
12232,41,2,19,I'm not a hooker.
12233,41,2,19,And you're not my best man.
12234,41,2,19,You've ruined my bachelor party.
12235,41,2,19,I don't know why you wouldn't just listen to me when I said I didn't want this.
12236,41,2,19,"Well, the fight started ten minutes ago. Maybe-maybe we should listen."
12237,41,2,19,"Oh, Doctor, what a fight!"
12238,41,2,19,That knockout will be talked about for years to come!
12239,41,2,19,Anyone lucky enough to be in the arena tonight just witnessed boxing history in the making!
12240,41,2,19,"Thank you so much, Margaret. I can't believe you carved that crucifix yourself."
12241,41,2,19,So talented.
12242,41,2,19,Didn't think you could carve.
12243,41,2,19,For you. Oh. And this one's from...
12244,41,2,19,Grandma Lois.
12245,41,2,19,"Oh. No, wait, darling."
12246,41,2,19,"Before you open this, I-I want to say a few words."
12247,41,2,19,"Okay, something you need to know."
12248,41,2,19,Grandma Lois thought she was giving her granddaughter an antique sewing machine.
12249,41,2,19,And we're back in.
12250,41,2,19,"Honey, this handy little device has been in our family for generations."
12251,41,2,19,"I used it, your great grandmother used it."
12252,41,2,19,"Now, her mother didn't use this one, but she used one just like it."
12253,41,2,19,"Of course, back then, they were made out of wood."
12254,41,2,19,"And, uh, I guess before that, you just had to do it by hand."
12255,41,2,19,"Would you pass the wine, please?"
12256,41,2,19,No.
12257,41,2,19,"Hey, Marshall, while we're here, you may as well go down to the morgue and climb into a drawer, 'cause that's what marriage is like."
12258,41,2,19,Can I get an amen?
12259,41,2,19,"Is everything all right at home, Stuart?"
12260,41,2,19,No.
12261,41,2,19,It's broken.
12262,41,2,19,"Oh, damn it, this is bad. I really can't lose this job."
12263,41,2,19,"My daughters are about to start school, and my fiancé, well... ever since he got back from Iraq, pretty much all he does is drink."
12264,41,2,19,"I think about leaving him, but..."
12265,41,2,19,I don't want my girls growing up without a dad like I did.
12266,41,2,19,I don't want them to know what that's like.
12267,41,2,19,"So, show time?"
12268,41,2,19,What is the matter with you?
12269,41,2,19,Her ankle's broken.
12270,41,2,19,I know for a fact that the second half of her act takes place largely in a seated or supine position.
12271,41,2,19,"Oh, that's true."
12272,41,2,19,"Treasure, please, don't worry about the show."
12273,41,2,19,"Uh, we'd feel bad."
12274,41,2,19,What does that mean?
12275,41,2,19,"No. We just mean, uh, you're off the hook."
12276,41,2,19,You don't have to do it.
12277,41,2,19,"I don't have to do it? Well, guess what?"
12278,41,2,19,I know I don't have to do it. I do it because I am good at it.
12279,41,2,19,"Look, I don't need your pity."
12280,41,2,19,All I want to do is give you a great show because you're getting married!
12281,41,2,19,Is that so much to ask? Is that such a major inconvenience?!
12282,41,2,19,"Oh, that is wrong."
12283,41,2,19,"Oh, that's just so wrong."
12284,41,2,19,"Well, the doctor did say for her to keep it elevated."
12285,41,2,19,"When I was a girl, my mother taught me and my sister to use it."
12286,41,2,19,We used to have contests to see who could finish faster.
12287,41,2,19,It was so exciting. The whole family would gather around to watch.
12288,41,2,19,"And when I was a new bride, this is what kept me buzy all those long nights when your grandfather was in Korea."
12289,41,2,19,"And speaking of your grandfather, though I don't think he'd care to admit this to any of his army buddies, but... he'd have a go at it every once in a while."
12290,41,2,19,And he enjoyed it.
12291,41,2,19,"Oh, open it up, sweetie."
12292,41,2,19,May this give for you as much joy as it's brought me.
12293,41,2,19,"Grandma, um..."
12294,41,2,19,Wow.
12295,41,2,19,"Well, take it out, honey. I want to show you how to use it."
12296,41,2,19,"Okay, no, no! Don't take it out."
12297,41,2,19,"Lily, that's not your grandma's gift. It's mine."
12298,41,2,19,"I panicked, and I switched the cards because I was embarrassed."
12299,41,2,19,"Well, what is it?"
12300,41,2,19,It's just like the one Miranda gave to Charlotte on s*x and the City.
12301,41,2,19,"Oh, I love that show. I always watch it on TBS."
12302,41,2,19,"Oh, you would. You're such a Samantha!"
12303,41,2,19,"Oh, I'm a Carrie! You're a Samantha!"
12304,41,2,19,And then the night became a whole new kind of uncomfortable.
12305,41,2,19,So where do I get one of these?
12306,41,2,19,Mom!
12307,41,2,19,"Man, what a show, huh?"
12308,41,2,19,She did some disgusting stuff. Really sticks with you.
12309,41,2,19,I may be done eating.
12310,41,2,19,"Me, too."
12311,41,2,19,"I mean, like, forever."
12312,41,2,19,"Me, too."
12313,41,2,19,I miss my wife.
12314,41,2,19,"Hey, let's go around the table and say what our favorite part was."
12315,41,2,19,Mine was that thing with the typewriter.
12316,41,2,19,"I mean, she made some spelling mistakes, but still."
12317,41,2,19,"Ooh, and you guys were all, ""Barney, put out the cigar!"
12318,41,2,19,"It's a non-smoking room!"" And I was all, ""Hell, no, this is a Cuban!"""
12319,41,2,19,"Of course, eventually, I did put it out."
12320,41,2,19,Did I put it out?
12321,41,2,19,I put it out.
12322,41,2,19,Did I put it out?
12323,41,2,19,I put it out.
12324,41,2,19,Did I put it out?
12325,41,2,19,"It was a small fire, not even big enough to force an evacuation of the hotel, but definitely big enough to get us kicked out, and bring Marshall's bachelor party to an early end."
12326,41,2,19,Is that...?
12327,41,2,19,It is.
12328,41,2,19,"Hey, guys."
12329,41,2,19,How was the fight?
12330,41,2,19,"Hey, what are you guys doing here? What happened to the bachelor party?"
12331,41,2,19,"We missed the fight, dinner was ruined, we spent half the night in the hospital, and got kicked out of the hotel."
12332,41,2,19,What do you think happened?
12333,41,2,19,Barney. Barney.
12334,41,2,19,"Hey, I was just trying to be a good best man."
12335,41,2,19,"You know what a best man does, Barney? He does what the groom wants."
12336,41,2,19,"But all you ever think about is what you want, what's best for you."
12337,41,2,19,Best man?
12338,41,2,19,I'm not even sure I'm inviting you to the wedding at this point.
12339,41,2,19,You don't mean that.
12340,41,2,19,Why should I invite you? You don't even want us to get married.
12341,41,2,19,That's not true.
12342,41,2,19,"Lily, don't."
12343,41,2,19,What?
12344,41,2,19,"I'm sorry, Barney."
12345,41,2,19,It happened last summer when we were broken up.
12346,41,2,19,"Hey, what are you guys talking about?"
12347,41,2,19,Lily.
12348,41,2,19,"Ah, I got to go."
12349,41,2,19,"Newark Airport, please."
12350,41,2,19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Barney, what are you doing here?"
12351,41,2,19,"I can't believe it's really you. Come in, have a seat."
12352,41,2,19,"Do you want some tea? I know the apartment's small, but I don't need much space. Let me show you some of my paintings."
12353,41,2,19,I think it's some of my best work ever. Just stop it.
12354,41,2,19,"Lily, you have to come home. You and Marshall belong together."
12355,41,2,19,The two of you have something that most people search their whole lives for and never find.
12356,41,2,19,"I know you love him, and if you knew what he was going through right now, you wouldn't be here for one more second."
12357,41,2,19,I bought you a ticket home.
12358,41,2,19,"Marshall is one of the best people I know, and it won't be long until someone else realizes that, and you'll lose him forever."
12359,41,2,19,"I can't stand the thought of that happening, and I cannot keep stealing chicks from him forever."
12360,41,2,19,"Never, ever tell anyone I was here. I will deny it tooth and nail."
12361,41,2,19,This trip never happened.
12362,41,2,19,"Hey, if you had three hours to kill before your flight, what would you do--"
12363,41,2,19,Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf?
12364,41,2,19,You really did that?
12365,41,2,19,"Marshall, I think Barney's your best man."
12366,41,2,19,Yeah.
12367,41,2,19,"Yes, he is."
12368,41,2,19,"See, Lily? This is why I didn't..."
12369,41,2,19,Really?
12370,41,2,19,Really.
12371,41,2,19,Real...
12372,41,2,19,"In your face, loser!"
12373,41,2,19,"Take it easy, all right. Ted's still my best man, too."
12374,41,2,19,You guys are co-best men.
12375,41,2,19,"Right. Yes, we're both best man."
12376,41,2,19,"No, um, seriously. You guys are co-best men."
12377,41,2,19,Of course.
12378,41,2,19,I can't believe you got me this.
12379,41,2,19,"Oh, I only did it as a joke. I can return it for you you want."
12380,41,2,19,"Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have to go all the way back down there."
12381,41,2,19,"I'll, I'll just throw it away."
12382,41,2,19,"Well, I mean, if you were going to throw it away, maybe I'll take it in case I get invited to another wedding shower."
12383,41,2,19,It's a great gag gift.
12384,41,2,19,"Yeah, it's really funny."
12385,41,2,19,You know who would get a kick out of it?
12386,41,2,19,Marshall.
12387,41,2,19,"So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it."
12388,41,2,19,"I would be embarrassed if Marshall found out that I bought it for you,"
12389,41,2,19,so I'd better just take it.
12390,42,2,20,"Ted (2030): When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening."
12391,42,2,20,Lily: Why does my stomach hurt?
12392,42,2,20,"Marshall: I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today."
12393,42,2,20,"Lily: Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant."
12394,42,2,20,"Tes: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent."
12395,42,2,20,"Lily: No, we're not."
12396,42,2,20,"Ted: Oh, really? What about the other day?"
12397,42,2,20,Flashback. Lily and Marshall are in the kitchen.
12398,42,2,20,"Lily: Oh, I need to get some eggs."
12399,42,2,20,"Marshall: Oh, I'll come with you."
12400,42,2,20,Marshall accompanies Lily up to the refrigerator. End of flashback.
12401,42,2,20,Marshall: Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.
12402,42,2,20,Barney: Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?
12403,42,2,20,"Marshall: Okay, we decided not to do that because of..."
12404,42,2,20,Lily: Logistics. Wedding logistics.
12405,42,2,20,"Marshall: Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up."
12406,42,2,20,Ted: You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.
12407,42,2,20,Marshall: Sure we could.
12408,42,2,20,Robin: Then why don't you? You can stay with me.
12409,42,2,20,Lily: It would make our wedding night more special.
12410,42,2,20,"Marshall: Okay, let's do it."
12411,42,2,20,Lily: Done.
12412,42,2,20,Marshall: I'm gonna go grab a beer.
12413,42,2,20,Lily: I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.
12414,42,2,20,CREDITS
12415,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Lily's on the phone. Robin and Ted come in..."
12416,42,2,20,"Lily: Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra...."
12417,42,2,20,"God, you guys are covered in sauce. We'll get to that. Me first. My mom is driving me crazy about the wedding music. The woman takes one cruise to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's ""not a party without steel drums."" Doesn't everybody know you're not supposed to stress out a bride right before her wedding?! Okay, sauce, go."
12418,42,2,20,Ted: Long story. I'll tell you later.
12419,42,2,20,"Barney: Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught."
12420,42,2,20,"Robin: Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons."
12421,42,2,20,"Marshall: Oh, you didn't. That's right."
12422,42,2,20,Barney: So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?
12423,42,2,20,"Marshall: You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be."
12424,42,2,20,"Lily: Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape."
12425,42,2,20,"Barney: Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying ""night-night"" to her?"
12426,42,2,20,Marshall: No.
12427,42,2,20,Lily: He doesn't say it. He sings it.
12428,42,2,20,"Barney: Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out."
12429,42,2,20,Lily: Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.
12430,42,2,20,Barney: What's on there?
12431,42,2,20,"Lily: Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer..."
12432,42,2,20,Barney: Retail price $319.99. What else?
12433,42,2,20,"Lily: Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum."
12434,42,2,20,"Barney: Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?"
12435,42,2,20,Marshall: Did you memorize our registry?
12436,42,2,20,"Barney: No, I'm training."
12437,42,2,20,Marshall: Training? For what?
12438,42,2,20,"Barney: I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?"
12439,42,2,20,"Ted: Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on."
12440,42,2,20,"Barney: Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right."
12441,42,2,20,Marshall: No way!
12442,42,2,20,Ted: What?!
12443,42,2,20,"Barney: Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down."
12444,42,2,20,"Marshall: Whoa, that is so awesome."
12445,42,2,20,"Robin: Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right."
12446,42,2,20,"Barney: Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars."
12447,42,2,20,Ted (2030): Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.
12448,42,2,20,Lily: I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.)
12449,42,2,20,"Robin: Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful."
12450,42,2,20,Lily: I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess! (she raises her arms and the dress falls.) I'm too skinny for my dress!
12451,42,2,20,At Ted's apartment...
12452,42,2,20,"Ted(2030): Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall."
12453,42,2,20,"Ted: Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?"
12454,42,2,20,Marshall: That's fantastic.
12455,42,2,20,"Ted: When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane."
12456,42,2,20,Flashback. Marshall's in the car and the siren oft he police rings...
12457,42,2,20,"Marshall: Oh, crap."
12458,42,2,20,Lily gets up...
12459,42,2,20,"Lily: Oh, crap."
12460,42,2,20,End of flashback.
12461,42,2,20,"Marshall: Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister."
12462,42,2,20,Ted: That grandpa died three years ago.
12463,42,2,20,"Marshall: His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance."
12464,42,2,20,"Barney comes into the apartment yelling, then he leaves again and yells diferently."
12465,42,2,20,"Barney: So which one, ""A"" or ""B""?"
12466,42,2,20,Marshall: What was that?
12467,42,2,20,"Barney: I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, ""Barney Stinson, come on down!"""
12468,42,2,20,"Ted: Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?"
12469,42,2,20,"Barney: Yeah, of course."
12470,42,2,20,"Barney leaves again, behind him Ted closes the door."
12471,42,2,20,"Barney: Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax."
12472,42,2,20,"At Robin's apartment, Lily's on the phone..."
12473,42,2,20,"Lily: It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?"
12474,42,2,20,Robin: What happened?
12475,42,2,20,"Lily: She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300."
12476,42,2,20,"Robin: Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?"
12477,42,2,20,"Lily: Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato."
12478,42,2,20,Robin: I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.
12479,42,2,20,Lily: Done!
12480,42,2,20,At the apartment...
12481,42,2,20,"Ted: Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship."
12482,42,2,20,"Marshall: I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,"
12483,42,2,20,"Ted: I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man."
12484,42,2,20,Marshall: Nice.
12485,42,2,20,"Ted: Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back..."
12486,42,2,20,"Flasback. In their college room, Lily and Marshall are sitting on the floor, when Ted comes in with the snacks, Lily doesn't see him."
12487,42,2,20,Marshall: I love you.
12488,42,2,20,"Lily: I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did."
12489,42,2,20,Marshall: Yeah. Ted leaves the room.
12490,42,2,20,End of flashback. Ted and Marshall are at the bar.
12491,42,2,20,"Marshall: So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family: drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food."
12492,42,2,20,"Ted: Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?"
12493,42,2,20,"Marshall: Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said ""I love you"" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns"
12494,42,2,20,"Ted: But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird."
12495,42,2,20,They join Robin and Lily at a table.
12496,42,2,20,"Marshall: Hey, Lil."
12497,42,2,20,Lily: Hey.
12498,42,2,20,Ted: Hey? That's it?
12499,42,2,20,Marshall: What are you talking about?
12500,42,2,20,"Ted: Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do"
12501,42,2,20,"Ted (2030): Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all."
12502,42,2,20,Barney comes in with the wheel of a bike.
12503,42,2,20,"Barney: Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel)"
12504,42,2,20,"Marshall: Oh, wow, that was pretty close."
12505,42,2,20,"Barney: Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!"
12506,42,2,20,"Ted: What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?"
12507,42,2,20,"Barney: Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father."
12508,42,2,20,Ted: Your father?
12509,42,2,20,Barney: That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.
12510,42,2,20,Ted: Your dad... is Bob Barker?
12511,42,2,20,Barney: That's right
12512,42,2,20,"Lily: The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?"
12513,42,2,20,Barney: That's Pops.
12514,42,2,20,Robin: Barney?
12515,42,2,20,"Bareney: Yes, Robin?"
12516,42,2,20,Robin: Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?
12517,42,2,20,"Barney: Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why."
12518,42,2,20,Flashback. Barney's a kid and he's wathing the Price is Right.
12519,42,2,20,"Barney: Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?"
12520,42,2,20,"Barney's mom: Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)"
12521,42,2,20,"Barney(in front oft he tv):Look, Dad, I got straight A's!"
12522,42,2,20,"Bareny (dressed as Bob Barker): Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?"
12523,42,2,20,"Barney (throwing a ball at the TV): Want to play some catch, Pop?"
12524,42,2,20,End of flashback.
12525,42,2,20,"Barney: So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am."
12526,42,2,20,Ted: You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?
12527,42,2,20,Barney: Why is this so hard for you people to believe?
12528,42,2,20,"Robin: Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there."
12529,42,2,20,Lily: This is the best wedding diet ever.
12530,42,2,20,
12531,42,2,20,At Robin's...
12532,42,2,20,Lily: I lost a pound.
12533,42,2,20,Robin: That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.
12534,42,2,20,Lily: I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.
12535,42,2,20,"Robin: Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!"
12536,42,2,20,Lily: I can't.
12537,42,2,20,"Robin: Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full."
12538,42,2,20,Lily: I'm trying.
12539,42,2,20,"Robin: Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!"
12540,42,2,20,Lily: Okay!
12541,42,2,20,At the apartment...
12542,42,2,20,"Ted: Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way."
12543,42,2,20,Marshall: Finally.
12544,42,2,20,"Ted: Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man."
12545,42,2,20,"Marshall: Still strong, right?"
12546,42,2,20,"Ted: Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall"
12547,42,2,20,Flashback. At the bar... Marshall and Lily kissing.
12548,42,2,20,"Ted: when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk."
12549,42,2,20,"Ted (last year): Man, I'm well nourished right now!"
12550,42,2,20,Barney: Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.
12551,42,2,20,"Robin: Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun."
12552,42,2,20,"Marshall: Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values."
12553,42,2,20,"Ted: Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered."
12554,42,2,20,Marshall: You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.
12555,42,2,20,Lily: Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?
12556,42,2,20,At the bathroom in the bar...
12557,42,2,20,"Ted: Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily."
12558,42,2,20,"Marshall: That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring."
12559,42,2,20,"Ted: Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints."
12560,42,2,20,"Lily: I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode."
12561,42,2,20,Marshall: I know.
12562,42,2,20,2 weeks later...
12563,42,2,20,"Ted: And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago."
12564,42,2,20,"Flashback. At the apartment, Ted comes into the livingroom and Marshall comes homes."
12565,42,2,20,"Ted: Marshall, what are you doing?"
12566,42,2,20,Marshall: Going to the bathroom.
12567,42,2,20,Ted: In the hall?
12568,42,2,20,Marshall: Sleepwalking?
12569,42,2,20,Ted: You're wide awake.
12570,42,2,20,Marshall: Robbing us?
12571,42,2,20,Ted: Dude.
12572,42,2,20,"Ted (giving the toast): Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily."
12573,42,2,20,Marshall and Lily are liying down on the bed of the hotel room.
12574,42,2,20,"Lily: God, I missed you."
12575,42,2,20,"Marshall: I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?"
12576,42,2,20,"Lily: Sure, baby."
12577,42,2,20,Marshall: How's the weight gaining going?
12578,42,2,20,"Lily: Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around."
12579,42,2,20,"Marshall: Well, I'm here now."
12580,42,2,20,"Ted(giving the toast): And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall."
12581,42,2,20,All: To Lily and Marshall.
12582,42,2,20,"Ted (2030): Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney."
12583,42,2,20,They're all at the apartment watching The Price Is Right...
12584,42,2,20,"Bob: Rich, what is the name of our next participant?"
12585,42,2,20,"Rich: Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right."
12586,42,2,20,"Barney: Nooo. Oh, my God!"
12587,42,2,20,"Bob: Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here."
12588,42,2,20,"At the apartment, all: Oh, my God!"
12589,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Barney: Yeah, I know, the camera loves me."
12590,42,2,20,"Bob: Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit."
12591,42,2,20,"Barney: Thanks, Da... Bob."
12592,42,2,20,Bob: Here is the next item up for bid!
12593,42,2,20,"Rich: Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches feature an 18k gold bezel and crown and stainless steel bands."
12594,42,2,20,"Bob: And Barney, what do you bid on that?"
12595,42,2,20,"Barney: Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob."
12596,42,2,20,"Bob: $1,350 for Barney."
12597,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Lily: So, was it $1,350?"
12598,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Barney: I don't know. Was it?"
12599,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Lily Oh, my God!"
12600,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Barney: Happy wedding."
12601,42,2,20,"Bob: Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive."
12602,42,2,20,"Barney: Thank you, Bob."
12603,42,2,20,"Bob: Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid."
12604,42,2,20,Barney: $1 billion.
12605,42,2,20,Bob: Lower.
12606,42,2,20,"Barney: So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday."
12607,42,2,20,"Bob: Yes, Barney. This is..."
12608,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Ted: What are you doing?"
12609,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Barney: Uh, spending some quality time with my dad."
12610,42,2,20,"Bob: That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding."
12611,42,2,20,"Barney: No, no, I want you to see this. This is great."
12612,42,2,20,Bob: Keep bidding.
12613,42,2,20,"Barney. This is me at my graduation. I know, the hair."
12614,42,2,20,"Bob: That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one..."
12615,42,2,20,Barney: $999.
12616,42,2,20,"Bob: Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!"
12617,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Barney: Happy wedding again!"
12618,42,2,20,"At the apartement, Lily: Oh, my..."
12619,42,2,20,"Barney: I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game."
12620,42,2,20,"Bob: I'm sure you'll do just fine, son."
12621,42,2,20,"Barney: Did you just... I'm ready, Bob."
12622,42,2,20,"Bob: Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around..."
12623,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Ted: Oh, no, you spun it too hard."
12624,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Robin: No, he didn't spin it hard enough."
12625,42,2,20,"Bob: Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far."
12626,42,2,20,"Barney: Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?"
12627,42,2,20,Bob: Sure.
12628,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Ted: That was kind of a weird moment."
12629,42,2,20,"Bob: Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?"
12630,42,2,20,"Barney: Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass."
12631,42,2,20,"Bob: Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?"
12632,42,2,20,"Millie: $17,640."
12633,42,2,20,"Bob: $17,640."
12634,42,2,20,Barney: Overbid!
12635,42,2,20,"Bob: Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery."
12636,42,2,20,"Barney: Oh, I love this."
12637,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Robin: I can't believe how excited I am right now"
12638,42,2,20,"Bob: Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?"
12639,42,2,20,"Barney: Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1."
12640,42,2,20,"At the apartment, Marshall: I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!"
12641,42,2,20,Bob: And the actual retail price of your showcase is...
12642,42,2,20,"Barney: $14,628."
12643,42,2,20,"Bob: $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet..."
12644,42,2,20,"Barney: Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right."
12645,42,2,20,"Bob: Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you..."
12646,42,2,20,Barney: Have your pets spayed or neutered.
12647,42,2,20,Ted: Why didn't you tell him?
12648,42,2,20,"Barney: Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it."
12649,42,2,20,Ted: Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.
12650,42,2,20,"Barney: Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!"
12651,42,2,20,Ted (2030): And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.
12652,42,2,20,Marshall's recording the good night tape for Lily.
12653,42,2,20,"Marshall: Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted."
12654,42,2,20,"Ted: No, it's weird."
12655,42,2,20,Marshall: You promised.
12656,43,2,21,"Ted (2030): In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York."
12657,43,2,21,Lily and Robin enter in a house...
12658,43,2,21,"Robin: Wow, it's beautiful, Lily."
12659,43,2,21,Lily: Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.
12660,43,2,21,"Ted (2030)Well, that was a load of crap. You see, kids, when you get married, you learn a hard lesson. The wedding you set out to have is almost never the wedding you end up with."
12661,43,2,21,"At the bar, 8 months before the wedding..."
12662,43,2,21,"Lily: So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle."
12663,43,2,21,Barney: And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.
12664,43,2,21,Robin: But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?
12665,43,2,21,"Barney: Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, ""I do."" Yeah."
12666,43,2,21,"Ted (2030): The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make."
12667,43,2,21,"At the apartment, 6 months before the wedding..."
12668,43,2,21,Lily: Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.
12669,43,2,21,"Robin: Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more."
12670,43,2,21,"Ted: Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?"
12671,43,2,21,Marshall: You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.
12672,43,2,21,"At the bar, 5 months before the wedding..."
12673,43,2,21,"Lily: So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player."
12674,43,2,21,"At the apartment, 3 months before the wedding..."
12675,43,2,21,"Lily: So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp."
12676,43,2,21,"Barney: Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross ""harp player"" off my list."
12677,43,2,21,Marshall: How long is this list?
12678,43,2,21,"Barney: Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass."
12679,43,2,21,"Lily: Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant."
12680,43,2,21,Barney: Sweet! I can cross off two things.
12681,43,2,21,CREDITS
12682,43,2,21,Ted (2030): And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.
12683,43,2,21,1 hour and 42 minutes before the wedding...
12684,43,2,21,"Andrea: Hi, Lily."
12685,43,2,21,Lily: Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.
12686,43,2,21,Andrea: Yeah.
12687,43,2,21,Robin: How do you play the harp with your belly so...?
12688,43,2,21,"Andrea: Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings."
12689,43,2,21,Robin: You only play half the harp?
12690,43,2,21,Andrea: Yeah.
12691,43,2,21,"Robin: Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?"
12692,43,2,21,Andrea: I've been studying the harp for 12 years.
12693,43,2,21,"Robin: Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of ""Guitar Hero""? Learned that in a day. Is there a ""Harp Hero""?"
12694,43,2,21,"Lily: Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?"
12695,43,2,21,Andrea: Tuesday.
12696,43,2,21,"Lily: Wow, that's soon."
12697,43,2,21,Andrea: Last Tuesday.
12698,43,2,21,1 hour and 38 minutes before the wedding...
12699,43,2,21,"Robin: Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony."
12700,43,2,21,"Lily: Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, ""Oh, my wedding has to be perfect."" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional."
12701,43,2,21,Barney arrives at the bar of the wedding...
12702,43,2,21,Barney: Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?
12703,43,2,21,Barman: No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.
12704,43,2,21,"Barney: Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy."
12705,43,2,21,"Barman: I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy."
12706,43,2,21,"Barney: You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy."
12707,43,2,21,In Lily's room...
12708,43,2,21,"Barney: Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? ""Hey, baby, want to pluck?"""
12709,43,2,21,Robin: Really? That didn't work.
12710,43,2,21,Barney: Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?
12711,43,2,21,Lily: Bill?
12712,43,2,21,Barney: Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.
12713,43,2,21,Flashback.
12714,43,2,21,Bill: Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?
12715,43,2,21,Barney: Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.
12716,43,2,21,"Bill: Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?"
12717,43,2,21,End of flasback.
12718,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?"
12719,43,2,21,Barney: He kind of did.
12720,43,2,21,Lily: That's Scooter.
12721,43,2,21,"Robin: Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?"
12722,43,2,21,Lily: His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.
12723,43,2,21,Robin: Why? Why would she do that?
12724,43,2,21,"Lily: Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine."
12725,43,2,21,Barney: I'll get it.
12726,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?"
12727,43,2,21,Barney: He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.
12728,43,2,21,Lily: Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.
12729,43,2,21,"Barney: Me, too. I was up all night."
12730,43,2,21,Barney leaves the room when Scooter comes in...
12731,43,2,21,"Scooter: Hello, Lily."
12732,43,2,21,"Barney: Hey, Bill."
12733,43,2,21,"Scooter: Hey, Barney."
12734,43,2,21,"Lily: Scooter, what are you doing here?"
12735,43,2,21,"Scooter: It's not ""Scooter"" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back."
12736,43,2,21,"Lily: You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?"
12737,43,2,21,"Scooter. Lily, I-I know it's crazy, but I love you, and if you can look me in the eye and tell me that you want to marry Marshall, I will leave right now and be out of your life forever."
12738,43,2,21,Lily: I want... I want... Scooter!
12739,43,2,21,Barney's back a the bar...
12740,43,2,21,Barney: I need a glass of wine.
12741,43,2,21,Barman: And I need you to get out of my face.
12742,43,2,21,"Barney: It's for the bride, so..."
12743,43,2,21,BarmanWhite or red?
12744,43,2,21,"Barney: White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda."
12745,43,2,21,Barman: You got it.
12746,43,2,21,Barney: She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.
12747,43,2,21,"Barman: I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some."
12748,43,2,21,"Barney: Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin."
12749,43,2,21,47 minutes before the wedding...
12750,43,2,21,Barney: Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.
12751,43,2,21,"Scooter: Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from ""November Rain."" By W. Axl Rose."
12752,43,2,21,Robin: That is a good song.
12753,43,2,21,Brad: Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?
12754,43,2,21,Scooter runs out...
12755,43,2,21,Brad: What's up with Bill?
12756,43,2,21,Robin: That's Scooter.
12757,43,2,21,Brad: I'm on it.
12758,43,2,21,People start to sit in the wedding place...
12759,43,2,21,Barney: Hey.
12760,43,2,21,Woman: Hey.
12761,43,2,21,Barney: Can I have your phone number?
12762,43,2,21,Woman: No.
12763,43,2,21,Barney: It's for the bride.
12764,43,2,21,Woman: Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.
12765,43,2,21,Barney: The bride wants you to walk slower.
12766,43,2,21,"40 minutes before the wedding, in Lily's wearing her dress..."
12767,43,2,21,"Robin: Oh, wow."
12768,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something."
12769,43,2,21,Robin: I have hairy nipples.
12770,43,2,21,Lily: Really?
12771,43,2,21,"Robin: No, but it worked, didn't it?"
12772,43,2,21,"Brad: Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered."
12773,43,2,21,"Robin: There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call..."
12774,43,2,21,"Lily: Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today."
12775,43,2,21,33 minutes before the wedding...
12776,43,2,21,Woman: I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.
12777,43,2,21,Lily: I'm okay.
12778,43,2,21,28 minutes before the wedding...
12779,43,2,21,"Man: I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot."
12780,43,2,21,Lily: I'm fine.
12781,43,2,21,24 minutes before the wedding...
12782,43,2,21,Andrea: Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.
12783,43,2,21,Lily: Totally cool.
12784,43,2,21,"Robin: Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry."
12785,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on."
12786,43,2,21,Robin: Are you sure?
12787,43,2,21,"Lily: I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway."
12788,43,2,21,"Robin: Lily, are you okay?"
12789,43,2,21,Lily: What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!
12790,43,2,21,"Robin: What happened to ""I don't want a perfect wedding""?"
12791,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today."
12792,43,2,21,"Robin: And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better."
12793,43,2,21,"Lily: What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having."
12794,43,2,21,Marshall enters in a room with something to hide his hair...
12795,43,2,21,"Marshall: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
12796,43,2,21,Ted: What?
12797,43,2,21,Marshall shows his hair and he has blond drills.
12798,43,2,21,"Barney: Well, it's not too short."
12799,43,2,21,Marshall: My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!
12800,43,2,21,"Barney: You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys."
12801,43,2,21,Ted: The good Backstreet Boys?
12802,43,2,21,Marshall: Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!
12803,43,2,21,Ted: What-what the hell happened to you?
12804,43,2,21,"Marshall: Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine."
12805,43,2,21,Flashback. Marshall's with Lily's cousin...
12806,43,2,21,"Marshall: So, um, just not-not too short, okay?"
12807,43,2,21,"Cousin: Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style."
12808,43,2,21,"Marshall: Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know."
12809,43,2,21,"Cousin: Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips."
12810,43,2,21,"Marshall: I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me."
12811,43,2,21,End of flashback.
12812,43,2,21,Marshall: I can't get married like this! There's no way!
12813,43,2,21,"Barney: Ah, let me see what I can do."
12814,43,2,21,Ted: What? What can you do?
12815,43,2,21,Barney: I have a superpower.
12816,43,2,21,Marshall: Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.
12817,43,2,21,Ted: That's crazy. Of course she will.
12818,43,2,21,Marshall: Would you marry me?
12819,43,2,21,Ted: No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.
12820,43,2,21,"Marshall: Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?"
12821,43,2,21,
12822,43,2,21,In the wedding room...
12823,43,2,21,"Barney: Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?"
12824,43,2,21,In Marshall's room...
12825,43,2,21,"Ted: Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution."
12826,43,2,21,"Marshall takes a razor and shaves the middle of his hair... Dude, you shaved your freakin' head."
12827,43,2,21,"Marshall: Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!"
12828,43,2,21,Ted: What?!
12829,43,2,21,Marshall: You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.
12830,43,2,21,"Ted: Dude, those guys are criminals."
12831,43,2,21,"Marshall: Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!"
12832,43,2,21,"Ted: Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these."
12833,43,2,21,Marshall: No!
12834,43,2,21,Ted's in the wedding room...
12835,43,2,21,"Ted: Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?"
12836,43,2,21,Ben: Yes.
12837,43,2,21,"Ted: Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out."
12838,43,2,21,Ben: Yeah.
12839,43,2,21,Ted: Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.
12840,43,2,21,"Ben: Oh, no!"
12841,43,2,21,"Ted: Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?"
12842,43,2,21,"Ben: Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one."
12843,43,2,21,"Ted: Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches"
12844,43,2,21,"his hair color, which is, which is kind of the same color as the top of your hair."
12845,43,2,21,"Ben: Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad."
12846,43,2,21,Ted: That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.
12847,43,2,21,"Ben: Boy, that's a pretty tall order."
12848,43,2,21,Ted: Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?
12849,43,2,21,"Ben: No, not off the top of my... No. Can't."
12850,43,2,21,Ted: Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.
12851,43,2,21,Barney: The bride needs this.
12852,43,2,21,"13 minutes before the wedding, Marshall's wearing the toupee."
12853,43,2,21,"Marshall: Actually, I think it kinda works."
12854,43,2,21,Ted: It totally does.
12855,43,2,21,Marshall: Barney?
12856,43,2,21,"Barney: To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it."
12857,43,2,21,"Marshall: Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?"
12858,43,2,21,"Ted: It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot."
12859,43,2,21,"Marshall: Oh, you know..."
12860,43,2,21,Ted: In a bad way.
12861,43,2,21,"Brad: Hey. Cool hair, bro."
12862,43,2,21,Ted: What happened to your shirt?
12863,43,2,21,Brad: I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.
12864,43,2,21,Ted: You gonna put another shirt on?
12865,43,2,21,"Brad: No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?"
12866,43,2,21,Marshall: What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?
12867,43,2,21,"Brad: Not for long, bro. Not for long."
12868,43,2,21,"Marshall: Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?"
12869,43,2,21,In the park...
12870,43,2,21,Barney: It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.
12871,43,2,21,"Ted: Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress."
12872,43,2,21,"Marshall: Oh, no."
12873,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh, my God! Marshall..."
12874,43,2,21,"Marshall: Lily, you're not supposed to see me."
12875,43,2,21,"Robin: Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you."
12876,43,2,21,Lily: What happened? Did Amy do this to you?
12877,43,2,21,"Marshall: Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?"
12878,43,2,21,"Lily: Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way."
12879,43,2,21,"Marshall: Yeah, I know. I heard."
12880,43,2,21,"Lily: My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear."
12881,43,2,21,"Marshall: What? No ""Property of Marshall"" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?"
12882,43,2,21,"Lily: What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?"
12883,43,2,21,Marshall: I wish we could have that wedding.
12884,43,2,21,Ted: So do it.
12885,43,2,21,Marshall: What?
12886,43,2,21,"Ted: Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate."
12887,43,2,21,"Barney: Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage."
12888,43,2,21,"Marshall: Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?"
12889,43,2,21,"Robin: Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here."
12890,43,2,21,"Marshall: What do you think, baby?"
12891,43,2,21,Lily: I love it.
12892,43,2,21,"Marshall: Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married."
12893,43,2,21,"Lily: Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?"
12894,43,2,21,Man: Okay.
12895,43,2,21,Lily: Thank you.
12896,43,2,21,Lily takes the hat and gives it to Marshall.
12897,43,2,21,Marshall: Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.
12898,43,2,21,"Barney: Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other."
12899,43,2,21,Robin: He's gonna cry.
12900,43,2,21,"Barney: No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?"
12901,43,2,21,"Marshall: Oh, no. I don't have my vows."
12902,43,2,21,Lily: I don't have mine either.
12903,43,2,21,Ted: You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.
12904,43,2,21,"Marshall: Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called ""Eggs Marshall,"" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy."
12905,43,2,21,Ted: No problem.
12906,43,2,21,Barney: It's totally okay.
12907,43,2,21,"Lily: My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, ""Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96."" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time."
12908,43,2,21,"Robin: Hey, I found your panties!"
12909,43,2,21,Lily: I'm good.
12910,43,2,21,"Barney: Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?"
12911,43,2,21,Lily: Slow down.
12912,43,2,21,Barney: I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?
12913,43,2,21,Marshall: I do.
12914,43,2,21,"Barney: Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?"
12915,43,2,21,Lily: I do.
12916,43,2,21,"Barney: Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride."
12917,43,2,21,They kiss
12918,43,2,21,Marshall: Did you smoke?
12919,43,2,21,Lily: No.
12920,43,2,21,Robin: Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.
12921,43,2,21,"Ted (2030): After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar."
12922,43,2,21,In a room...
12923,43,2,21,Marshall: How do you feel?
12924,43,2,21,Lily: Tired. I got married twice today.
12925,43,2,21,"Marshall: So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?"
12926,43,2,21,"Lily: What do you think? Bathroom, of course."
12927,43,2,21,In the bathroom...
12928,43,2,21,Ted: Please don't.
12929,44,2,22,"Man: Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin."
12930,44,2,22,Lily: Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?
12931,44,2,22,"Marshall: You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little."
12932,44,2,22,Lily: You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.
12933,44,2,22,"Marshall: Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker."
12934,44,2,22,Lily: Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.
12935,44,2,22,Marshall: I got it. You ready? You ready?
12936,44,2,22,Lily: Yeah.
12937,44,2,22,"Marshall: Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?"
12938,44,2,22,"Lily: I love you, Mr. Awesome."
12939,44,2,22,"Marshall: I love you, Mrs. Awesome."
12940,44,2,22,They kiss... Robin and Ted dancing...
12941,44,2,22,Ted: So...
12942,44,2,22,Robin: So...
12943,44,2,22,Ted: Wedding's over.
12944,44,2,22,"Robin: Yes, it is."
12945,44,2,22,"Ted: I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people."
12946,44,2,22,Barney: Tell people what?
12947,44,2,22,"Robin: Hi, Barney."
12948,44,2,22,Barney: Tell people what?
12949,44,2,22,"Ted: The food looks delicious, doesn't it?"
12950,44,2,22,Barney: Tell people what?
12951,44,2,22,Robin: Nothing.
12952,44,2,22,"Barney: Oh, okay. Tell people what?"
12953,44,2,22,Ted: Can we talk about this later?
12954,44,2,22,Barney: Absolutely. Tell people what?
12955,44,2,22,Robin: Hi. Have you met Barney?
12956,44,2,22,"Barney: Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?"
12957,44,2,22,"Ted: Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?"
12958,44,2,22,Barney: Okay. (Barney leaves)
12959,44,2,22,"Ted: Whoo, that was a close one."
12960,44,2,22,Robin: Think he'll actually let it go?
12961,44,2,22,Barney(with a microphone) Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people... (A man tells him something) There's a black Nissan Stanza in the parking lot with it's lights on. Tell people what? Tell people what?
12962,44,2,22,CREDITS
12963,44,2,22,Ted and Robin are at the bar of the wedding...
12964,44,2,22,Robin: Can I get a water please?
12965,44,2,22,Barney: Tell people what?
12966,44,2,22,"Robin: Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news."
12967,44,2,22,Ted: But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.
12968,44,2,22,Robin: So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.
12969,44,2,22,Barney: Fine.
12970,44,2,22,"Ted: It's pretty big, though."
12971,44,2,22,"Barney: Oh, my God, just tell me!"
12972,44,2,22,"Lily: Oh, help us."
12973,44,2,22,Robin: What's wrong?
12974,44,2,22,"Lily: We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it."
12975,44,2,22,"Marshall: Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day."
12976,44,2,22,"Robin: All right, let's run some interference."
12977,44,2,22,"Ted: Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on."
12978,44,2,22,"Lily's grandma: Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful."
12979,44,2,22,"Lily: Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to..."
12980,44,2,22,Lily's grandma: And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.
12981,44,2,22,Marshall: And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.
12982,44,2,22,"Robin: All right, let's get these two back to their table."
12983,44,2,22,"Lily's grandma: We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?"
12984,44,2,22,Ted(2030): The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.
12985,44,2,22,Flashback. At Ted's apartment.
12986,44,2,22,Robin: Conga line.
12987,44,2,22,"Lily: Oh, yes, definitely."
12988,44,2,22,"Ted: How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and ending with your baby photos side by side."
12989,44,2,22,"Lily: Oh, that's great. Going on the list."
12990,44,2,22,Barney: What list?
12991,44,2,22,Lily: Horrible wedding clichées we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.
12992,44,2,22,"Barney: Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding."
12993,44,2,22,Robin: How's it go?
12994,44,2,22,"Marshall: ""Love is patient and kind. ""Love does not envy or boast. ""It is not arrogant or rude. ""Love does not insist on it's own way. ""It is not irritable or resentful. ""Love bears all things, ""believes all things, ""hopes all things... ""endures all things."""
12995,44,2,22,Robin: Lame.
12996,44,2,22,Lily: Going on the list.
12997,44,2,22,End of flashack. Back to the wedding.
12998,44,2,22,Lily: We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.
12999,44,2,22,"Ted: Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?"
13000,44,2,22,"Lily: Well, okay, one clichée."
13001,44,2,22,"Marshall: Well, technically two."
13002,44,2,22,Lily: No! They cleared our plates again!
13003,44,2,22,"Marshall: Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you."
13004,44,2,22,"Lily: Well, you still have me."
13005,44,2,22,Marshall: Yeah...
13006,44,2,22,"Barney: Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great."
13007,44,2,22,"Lily: No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well..."
13008,44,2,22,Barney: Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.
13009,44,2,22,"Ted: Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?"
13010,44,2,22,"Barney: Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew."
13011,44,2,22,"Ted: What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives."
13012,44,2,22,Barney: Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.
13013,44,2,22,"Robin: Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over..."
13014,44,2,22,Flashback. At the restaurant...
13015,44,2,22,Waiter: Champagne?
13016,44,2,22,"Robin: Um, we didn't order champagne."
13017,44,2,22,Waiter: Compliments of the house.
13018,44,2,22,Ted: Wow. Thanks. Cheers.
13019,44,2,22,"Robin (voive over): And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is..."
13020,44,2,22,End of flashback. At the wedding...
13021,44,2,22,Lily: Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.
13022,44,2,22,"Barney: Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?"
13023,44,2,22,"Ted: Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, ""Champagne?"" ""We didn't order any champagne."" ""Compliments of the house."" ""Wow."""
13024,44,2,22,Barney: You said that already!
13025,44,2,22,Flashback. At the restaurant...
13026,44,2,22,"Ted (voice over): Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass..."
13027,44,2,22,Robin: Is an engagement ring.
13028,44,2,22,End of Flashback.
13029,44,2,22,Man( with a camera): Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?
13030,44,2,22,Barney: Don't get married.
13031,44,2,22,Man: Why don't I come back.
13032,44,2,22,"Barney: An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do"
13033,44,2,22,"this to me. No. No, no, no!"
13034,44,2,22,Ted: That's what she said.
13035,44,2,22,Flashback.
13036,44,2,22,No.
13037,44,2,22,"Robin: No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no."
13038,44,2,22,Ted: What are you talking about?
13039,44,2,22,"Robin: This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here."
13040,44,2,22,Ted: That's not mine.
13041,44,2,22,Robin: What?
13042,44,2,22,Ted: That's not mine.
13043,44,2,22,Robin: Then whose is it?
13044,44,2,22,Man: It's mine. Janna... will you marry me?
13045,44,2,22,Janna: Yes.
13046,44,2,22,Robin: Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway.
13047,44,2,22,Ted: What the hell was that?
13048,44,2,22,Robin: What the hell was what?
13049,44,2,22,Ted: That reaction?
13050,44,2,22,Robin: I thought you were proposing to me.
13051,44,2,22,Ted: Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.
13052,44,2,22,"Robin: Ted, you know how I feel about marriage."
13053,44,2,22,Ted: Now more than ever.
13054,44,2,22,"Robin: I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?"
13055,44,2,22,Ted: No.
13056,44,2,22,Robin: Then why is this an issue?
13057,44,2,22,"Ted: Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, ""No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ""Ted, you cannot do this to me. ""No. No, no, no."""
13058,44,2,22,"Robin: Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go?"
13059,44,2,22,Ted: No.
13060,44,2,22,End of flashback.
13061,44,2,22,"Marshall: Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain."
13062,44,2,22,Robin: So did you guys find anything to eat?
13063,44,2,22,Lily: I had four strawberries.
13064,44,2,22,Ted: Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?
13065,44,2,22,Lily (burping): Yes.
13066,44,2,22,"Marshall: Lily, you could have burped or said the word ""Yes,"" but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you."
13067,44,2,22,"Lily: Oh, look, more strawberries!"
13068,44,2,22,Barney: So what happened next?
13069,44,2,22,Flashback.
13070,44,2,22,"Robin: Ted, don't do this."
13071,44,2,22,"Ted: No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years?"
13072,44,2,22,Robin: Where do you see yourself?
13073,44,2,22,"Ted: Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married."
13074,44,2,22,Robin: And I probably want to be in Argentina.
13075,44,2,22,Ted: Argentina?
13076,44,2,22,"Robin: Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure."
13077,44,2,22,"Ted: We have an expiration date, don't we?"
13078,44,2,22,End of flashback.
13079,44,2,22,"Barney: Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it."
13080,44,2,22,Ted: Barney... story's not over.
13081,44,2,22,Flashback.
13082,44,2,22,Robin: Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?
13083,44,2,22,"Ted: Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually..."
13084,44,2,22,"Waiter: Oh, my God, it's you."
13085,44,2,22,Ted: Wha... what?
13086,44,2,22,Waiter: You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.
13087,44,2,22,Ted: Run!
13088,44,2,22,End of flashback.
13089,44,2,22,
13090,44,2,22,Barney: Run? Your strategy was run?
13091,44,2,22,Ted: It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.
13092,44,2,22,Robin: Yeah? And how did that work out for you?
13093,44,2,22,"Ted and Robin run and knock down the tray that the waiter was holding, at Robin's apartment..."
13094,44,2,22,Ted: I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back.
13095,44,2,22,"Robin: Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?"
13096,44,2,22,"Flashback, at the restaurant..."
13097,44,2,22,"Ted: Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!"
13098,44,2,22,Ted runs and fall. End of flashback..
13099,44,2,22,Ted: So... Argentina.
13100,44,2,22,Robin: Argentina.
13101,44,2,22,Ted: Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?
13102,44,2,22,"Robin: Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there."
13103,44,2,22,Ted: I could want to live in Argentina.
13104,44,2,22,"Robin: No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does."
13105,44,2,22,"Ted: Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents."
13106,44,2,22,"Robin: So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?"
13107,44,2,22,"Ted: Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina."
13108,44,2,22,"Robin: Oh, shut up."
13109,44,2,22,Ted: You're scared I might not be kidding.
13110,44,2,22,Robin: Aren't you?
13111,44,2,22,"Ted: Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky."
13112,44,2,22,Robin: Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.
13113,44,2,22,End of flashback...
13114,44,2,22,"Barney: No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty."
13115,44,2,22,Robin: Right? Right?
13116,44,2,22,Barney: You caught the bouquet?
13117,44,2,22,Ted: Barney. The story's not over yet.
13118,44,2,22,Flashback. Ted and Robin are in Robin's apartment kissing.
13119,44,2,22,"Robin: Wait, wait, wait, wait."
13120,44,2,22,Ted: What?
13121,44,2,22,Robin: I don't know if I can do this to you.
13122,44,2,22,Ted: Do what?
13123,44,2,22,"Robin: Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids."
13124,44,2,22,"Ted: Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black ""X"" over Argentina."
13125,44,2,22,Robin: You know what I mean.
13126,44,2,22,"Ted: No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect."
13127,44,2,22,"Robin: Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies."
13128,44,2,22,Enf of flashback
13129,44,2,22,"Barney: That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted."
13130,44,2,22,Flashback. Ted and Robin are kissing on the couch.
13131,44,2,22,"Robin: Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?"
13132,44,2,22,"Ted. No, I don't."
13133,44,2,22,"Robin: Well, we probably shouldn't."
13134,44,2,22,Ted: Yeah.
13135,44,2,22,Robin: Risk it?
13136,44,2,22,Ted: Risk it.
13137,44,2,22,End of flashback.
13138,44,2,22,Barney: No.
13139,44,2,22,"Man: All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake."
13140,44,2,22,"Barney: No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over."
13141,44,2,22,"Robin: Come on, they're cutting the cake."
13142,44,2,22,"Barney: Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant."
13143,44,2,22,"Marshall: Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clichée, remember?"
13144,44,2,22,"Lily: No, it's going to be so funny."
13145,44,2,22,"Marshall: Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. (Lily's so drunk that she falls)"
13146,44,2,22,Lily: Whoopsy-daisy.
13147,44,2,22,"Marshall: And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much."
13148,44,2,22,Lily: We love you. I love you.
13149,44,2,22,The man who was with the camera comes back near Barney...
13150,44,2,22,"Barney: Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake."
13151,44,2,22,"Man: God, this guy's giving me nothing."
13152,44,2,22,"Ted: All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, ""What's up?"""
13153,44,2,22,"Marshall: Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave."
13154,44,2,22,"Ted: Hey, kiddo."
13155,44,2,22,BarneyYou are going to miss out on a lot of awesome stuff. You'll be at home with the kid while I am out awesome-ing all over the place. And you're going to get fat.
13156,44,2,22,"Ted: The story's not over, Barney."
13157,44,2,22,Flashback
13158,44,2,22,"Ted: Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro."
13159,44,2,22,"Robin: Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out."
13160,44,2,22,Ted: Not a euphemism.
13161,44,2,22,"Robin: Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave."
13162,44,2,22,"Ted: Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister."
13163,44,2,22,Robin: That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.
13164,44,2,22,"Ted: Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so..."
13165,44,2,22,"Robin: Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we?"
13166,44,2,22,"Ted: We're not doing this, are we?"
13167,44,2,22,Robin: I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
13168,44,2,22,Ted: And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.
13169,44,2,22,Robin: So where does that leave us?
13170,44,2,22,Ted: Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn.
13171,44,2,22,Robin: You stole a blue French horn for me.
13172,44,2,22,Ted: I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.

13176,44,2,22,Barney: You're not pregnant?
13177,44,2,22,Robin: Nope.
13178,44,2,22,Barney: An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?
13179,44,2,22,"Ted: Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so..."
13180,44,2,22,Robin: We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.
13181,44,2,22,Barney: You guys okay?
13182,44,2,22,"Ted: Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but..."
13183,44,2,22,Robin: But we're okay.
13184,44,2,22,Ted: The open bar helps.
13185,44,2,22,"Kid: Excuse me, Miss."
13186,44,2,22,Robin: Hi.
13187,44,2,22,Kid: Could I have this dance?
13188,44,2,22,"Ted: Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man."
13189,44,2,22,Marshall and Lily are in a limo...
13190,44,2,22,"Marshall: This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver."
13191,44,2,22,Ranjit: Hello!
13192,44,2,22,"Marshall: Ranjit!! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?"
13193,44,2,22,"Ranjit: You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch."
13194,44,2,22,"Marshall: Um, no, we actually had something else in mind."
13195,44,2,22,Ranjit: Okay.
13196,44,2,22,In a fast food..
13197,44,2,22,"Marshall: Lily, go sit down."
13198,44,2,22,Man: Welcome to Wienerburger.
13199,44,2,22,"Marshall: Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions."
13200,44,2,22,Man: Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?
13201,44,2,22,"Marshall: No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married."
13202,44,2,22,Man: Wow. Congratulations.
13203,44,2,22,Marshall: Thank you.
13204,44,2,22,"Man: That's $7.80. Hey, dude."
13205,44,2,22,Marshall: Yeah.
13206,44,2,22,"Man: I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash."
13207,44,2,22,Marshall: My wife...
13208,44,2,22,"Ted (2030): So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar."
13209,44,2,22,Ted meets Barney in the terrace.
13210,44,2,22,"Barney: I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together."
13211,44,2,22,"Ted: Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?"
13212,44,2,22,"Barney: The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for ""the one"" again. The only time I want to hear you saying ""the one"" is if it's followed by the word ""hundredth."" What up?"
13213,44,2,22,"Ted: No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?"
13214,44,2,22,"Barney: Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty."
13215,44,2,22,Ted: Yeah.
13216,44,2,22,"Barney: I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there."
13217,44,2,22,Ted: Could be.
13218,44,2,22,Barney: Ted?
13219,44,2,22,"Ted: Yes, Barney."
13220,44,2,22,Barney: Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?
13221,44,2,22,Ted: I do.

Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full."
13227,45,3,1,Ted: I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.
13228,45,3,1,Barney: When will you be ready?
13229,45,3,1,"Narrator: It was a good question. (Flashback of Robin and Ted hugging after breaking up) After a big relationship ends, you need some time to recuperate. Robin took a trip to Argentina, and I went through my usual routine. (End Flashback)"

13253,45,3,1,"Lily: What do you mean ""Win the breakup"", old timey inventor."
13254,45,3,1,"Marshall: What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers."
13255,45,3,1,"Lily: It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition."
13256,45,3,1,Marshall: That's my wife.
13257,45,3,1,"Barney: Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?"

13265,45,3,1,"Robin: It's pronounced ""guy-el""."
13266,45,3,1,"Gael: It's means ""joyful"". That is why I live my life by bringing joy, good energy and happiness to others. Especially those less fortunate that I."

13270,45,3,1,Ted: (With only a mustache now) What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.
13271,45,3,1,"Barney: That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner."
13272,45,3,1,"Ted: And, oh, he is a masseuse."
13273,45,3,1,[Flashback to Earlier. They talking at the bar.]
13274,45,3,1,Gael: With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat.
13275,45,3,1,"Ted: One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it."
13276,45,3,1,Gael: Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.
13277,45,3,1,"Barney: How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me."
13278,45,3,1,[End Flashback]
13279,45,3,1,[The Apartment]
13280,45,3,1,Barney: Not possible. You cannot have s*x on a windsurfing board.
13281,45,3,1,Lily: How do you know?
13282,45,3,1,"Barney: Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have s*x. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had s*x in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule."
13283,45,3,1,"Lily: To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian."
13284,45,3,1,Barney: This conversation never happened.
13285,45,3,1,"Ted: All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing."

13287,45,3,1,"Ted: You guys, have fun of your duble date."
13288,45,3,1,"Lily: Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull."
13289,45,3,1,[Flashback to Earlier. They talking at the bar.]
13290,45,3,1,Gael: And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars.
13291,45,3,1,"Lily: Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?"

13293,45,3,1,[The Apartment]
13294,45,3,1,Marshall: There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.
13295,45,3,1,"Lily: No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy."
13296,45,3,1,"Marshall: Well, you did."
13297,45,3,1,Lily: I'm one of the lucky few.
13298,45,3,1,"Marshall: Lily, Ted is our best friend, so let's get something straight: Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact."

13307,45,3,1,"Barney: Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah."

13313,45,3,1,[The Apartment - Robin/Gael/Marshall/Lily]Robin: I'm sorry this is all so weird.
13314,45,3,1,Marshall: Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot?
13315,45,3,1,"Lily: I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God!"
13316,45,3,1,Robin: I just hope Ted's okay.
13317,45,3,1,Marshall: Hmm.
13318,45,3,1,"Gael: I hate to see you so tense. (Begins massaging her) I mean, we had a really clean break up, you know? We really acted like adults, so the last thing... Oh! Oh, God, oh!"

13320,45,3,1,"Marshall: Gael, are you properly licensed massage therapist?"
13321,45,3,1,Gael: What?
13322,45,3,1,Marshall: Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity?
13323,45,3,1,Gael: I train for three years at an institute in Buenos Aires. I have a card. I can show you.
13324,45,3,1,Marshall: Is the card laminated?
13325,45,3,1,"Gael: What do you mean ""laminated""?"

13337,45,3,1,"Ted: Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out."
13338,45,3,1,"Barney: Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?"
13339,45,3,1,Ted: Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.
13340,45,3,1,Barney: Yeah. But I didn't get to help.
13341,45,3,1,Ted: So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?

14687,49,3,5,(Barney writes the word 'hot' on the y-axis of graph)
14688,49,3,5,"Barney: Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."
14689,49,3,5,(Barney draws an 'x' on the graph)
14690,49,3,5,"Barney: If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."
14691,49,3,5,(Barney draws another 'x' up and to the right of the first 'x')
14692,49,3,5,Barney: You want the girl to be above this line
14693,49,3,5,(Barney draws a line at 45 degree angle)
14694,49,3,5,"Barney: Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head..."
14695,49,3,5,(Barney draws circle in 'crazy' part of scale)
14696,49,3,5,Barney:...then lose ten pounds.
14697,49,3,5,(Barney moves his finger to the left into 'hot' part of scale and draws another circle)
14698,49,3,5,Barney: She'd stab me with a fork...
14699,49,3,5,(Barney moves his finger higher up on the 'crazy' side of the scale and draws another circle)
14700,49,3,5,Barney:... then get a boob job.
14701,49,3,5,(Barney moves his finger to the left into the 'hot' side of the scale and draws another circle)
14702,49,3,5,Barney: I should give her a call.

14706,49,3,5,"Ted: OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class."
14707,49,3,5,"Barney: I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts..."
14708,49,3,5,Ted: She's not crazy.
14709,49,3,5,"Barney: OK, we'll see."
14710,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14711,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted."
14712,49,3,5,Barney: It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.
14713,49,3,5,Ted: You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.
14714,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Yeah. Marshall: All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.'"
14715,49,3,5,Lily: Aw.
14716,49,3,5,Marshall: Starts with it too.
14717,49,3,5,"Future Ted VO: When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance."
14718,49,3,5,Lily: It was late August 1996
14719,49,3,5,Marshall: Lily and I were both freshmen moving into
14720,49,3,5,"Lily, Marshall: Hewitt Hall."
14721,49,3,5,"(flashback to 'the year 1996,; College Lily in her dorm room)"
14722,49,3,5,Marshall VO: And she needed some help setting up her stereo.
14723,49,3,5,(College Lily walking down hallway to room 110)
14724,49,3,5,"Lily VO: For some unknown reason, I felt drawn to room 110."
14725,49,3,5,Marshall VO: As if she knew that someone very special was behind that door.
14726,49,3,5,"Lily VO: And as fate would have it, that someone was Marshall."
14727,49,3,5,"Marshall, Lily VO: It was love at first sight."
14728,49,3,5,College Marshall: Hi.
14729,49,3,5,College Lily: Hi.
14730,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14731,49,3,5,Blah-blah: Ohhh.
14732,49,3,5,"Marshall: I know, right?"
14733,49,3,5,"Future Ted VO: Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different."
14734,49,3,5,(flashback to College Ted and College Marshall playing video games in their dorm room)
14735,49,3,5,"Marshall: Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today, (singing) wanna tap that."
14736,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14737,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did."
14738,49,3,5,(Everyone nods in silence)
14739,49,3,5,Blah-blah: Saw 'aw.'
14740,49,3,5,Everyone: Aw.
14741,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys."
14742,49,3,5,"(Blah-blah gets up and walks over to bar, Barney looks at Ted)"
14743,49,3,5,"Ted: Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks."
14744,49,3,5,(Barney is about to say something) Ted: Shut up.
14745,49,3,5,"(back from commercial break) Blah-blah: So, we know how Marshall and Lily met. Robin, how did you and Barney meet?"
14746,49,3,5,"Robin: No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No."
14747,49,3,5,Barney: Really? Sixteen no's. Really?
14748,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: So, you're single."
14749,49,3,5,Robin: Yeah.
14750,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great."
14751,49,3,5,"Ted: You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college."
14752,49,3,5,"(flashback to 'the year 1996,' College Marshall is sitting on bottom bunk in dorm room reading magazine)"
14753,49,3,5,"Future Ted VO: Kids, to understand this story, you need to know that your Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich."
14754,49,3,5,"(College Marshall brings a sandwich up to his mouth, takes a bit and starts laughing, College Guy runs and pokes head through Marshall's door)"
14755,49,3,5,"College Guy: Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich."
14756,49,3,5,"(College Guy runs off, College Marshall gets up and puts his sandwich out in an ashtray, covers sandwich with his magazine, Marshall sprays air freshener in room, College Ted enters through door)"
14757,49,3,5,College Ted: Hey.
14758,49,3,5,"College Marshall: Good afternoon, sir. I'm Marshall Eriksen. College Ted: Sir? Please, just call me Ted."
14759,49,3,5,(College Marshall and College Ted shake hands)
14760,49,3,5,"College Marshall: OK, Dean Ted."
14761,49,3,5,College Ted: Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich.
14762,49,3,5,College Marshall: What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school.
14763,49,3,5,"College Ted: So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway."
14764,49,3,5,(College Ted puts his bags on the top bunk)
14765,49,3,5,College Marshall: What do you mean?
14766,49,3,5,College Ted: I'm your new roommate. College Marshall: This is so unfair.
14767,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14768,49,3,5,Marshall: I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.
14769,49,3,5,"(flashback to College Ted eating sandwich in dorm room, Marshall walks in)"
14770,49,3,5,Marshall: You're not the dean.
14771,49,3,5,(College Marshall and College Ted start laughing)
14772,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14773,49,3,5,"Robin: College, good times."
14774,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap."
14775,49,3,5,"Barney: Oh, here we go."
14776,49,3,5,(Barney claps lightly)
14777,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags."
14778,49,3,5,Barney: Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.
14779,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?"
14780,49,3,5,"Robin: Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?"
14781,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?"
14782,49,3,5,"Robin: Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted."
14783,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Wow, that just came out of nowhere."
14784,49,3,5,"Robin: No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about."
14785,49,3,5,Blah-blah: I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?
14786,49,3,5,"Robin: No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be."
14787,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable."
14788,49,3,5,"Ted: You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please."
14789,49,3,5,"Barney: OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it."
14790,49,3,5,"(flashback to 'the year 2001,' Barney and Ted are at the urinals standing next to each other)"
14791,49,3,5,Barney: Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.
14792,49,3,5,"Ted: Oh, I'm sorry about that."
14793,49,3,5,"Barney: No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh."
14794,49,3,5,"Ted: Oh man, I'm really sorry."
14795,49,3,5,(Ted flushes and walks toward sink)
14796,49,3,5,"Barney: Wow, you bought that?"
14797,49,3,5,(Barney flushes and walks toward sink)
14798,49,3,5,"Ted: What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?"
14799,49,3,5,Ted: Ted.
14800,49,3,5,"Barney: Are you a total idiot, Ted?"
14801,49,3,5,"Ted: Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: (laughs) Well played."
14802,49,3,5,(Barney walks toward door and opens it)
14803,49,3,5,Barney: I like you Ted.
14804,49,3,5,"('fifteen minutes later,' Ted sitting at booth, Barney slides in next to him)"
14805,49,3,5,"Barney: Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live."
14806,49,3,5,(Ted looks at Barney confused)
14807,49,3,5,Barney: Barney. We met at the urinal.
14808,49,3,5,"Ted: Oh right, hi."
14809,49,3,5,"Barney: Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit."
14810,49,3,5,Ted: I'm not wearing a suit.
14811,49,3,5,"Barney: Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A."
14812,49,3,5,(Barney points to himself)
14813,49,3,5,"Barney: Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes."
14814,49,3,5,(Audrey walks over to Barney and Ted's booth and sits down)
14815,49,3,5,"Barney: Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward."
14816,49,3,5,"Barney: (yelling at Ted) Edward, this is Audrey."
14817,49,3,5,"Audrey: You know, I actually know some sign language."
14818,49,3,5,"Audrey: (signing) Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you"
14819,49,3,5,Barney: He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.
14820,49,3,5,Ted: (signing) I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.
14821,49,3,5,Barney: What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.
14822,49,3,5,Ted: (signing) My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.
14823,49,3,5,"(Ted hands Audrey a pen, Audrey writes on a napkin and slides it over to Barney)"
14824,49,3,5,Audrey: Here. Call me.
14825,49,3,5,"(Audrey gets up and leaves, Barney looks at Ted and gives him a thumbs-up)"
14826,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14827,49,3,5,"Barney: And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever."
14828,49,3,5,"Ted: Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently."
14829,49,3,5,(flashback to Ted signing to Audrey)
14830,49,3,5,Ted: (signing) He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.
14831,49,3,5,(Ted hands Audrey a pen)
14832,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14833,49,3,5,"Barney: Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online."
14834,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Oh my God, you told them."
14835,49,3,5,"Ted: OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies."
14836,49,3,5,"Barney: Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?"
14837,49,3,5,"(flashback to 'the year 2005,' Ted standing in bar with Barney behind him, Ted notices Robin, Robin sees Ted and smiles)"
14838,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14839,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Wait, you guys dated. For how long?"
14840,49,3,5,"Robin: A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about s*x, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?"
14841,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name."
14842,49,3,5,(Blah-blah gets up and leaves table and walks over to bar)
14843,49,3,5,"Ted: Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that."
14844,49,3,5,(Ted gets up and follows Blah-blah)
14845,49,3,5,
14846,49,3,5,"Barney: Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale."
14847,49,3,5,(Barney visualizes scale with diagonal line)
14848,49,3,5,Barney: She started the night here
14849,49,3,5,(Barney draws circle on 'hot' side of scale)
14850,49,3,5,"Barney: But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone."
14851,49,3,5,"(Barney makes straight line across diagonal which circle follows, red zone in very crazy territory appears)"
14852,49,3,5,Barney: Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.
14853,49,3,5,(Ted and Blah-blah talk over by bar)
14854,49,3,5,"Ted: I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin."
14855,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now."
14856,49,3,5,(Ted and Blah-blah look over at Robin who's sitting at booth eating)
14857,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that."
14858,49,3,5,Ted: Their story is not as magical as it seems.
14859,49,3,5,Blah-blah: What do you mean?
14860,49,3,5,"Ted: No, I can't, it's kind of a secret."
14861,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight."
14862,49,3,5,"(Blah-blah whispers in Ted's ear, hot-crazy scale appears with circle in 'crazy' area moving up into the 'hot' area)"
14863,49,3,5,"Ted: The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party."
14864,49,3,5,"(flashback to 'the year 1996,' college party, College Ted and College Lily look at each other from different parts of room, College Ted approaches College Lily)"
14865,49,3,5,"College Ted: Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist."
14866,49,3,5,"College Lily: Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220."
14867,49,3,5,"College Ted: No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by."
14868,49,3,5,"College Lily: Maybe I will, Hewitt 110."
14869,49,3,5,College students: Chug chug chug chug
14870,49,3,5,(College Marshall is being held upside-down over keg with beer being directly poured into his mouth through spigot)
14871,49,3,5,"College Ted: These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe."
14872,49,3,5,"(College Ted takes College Lily's drink and hands her a glass of wine, College Lily takes a sip of the wine)"
14873,49,3,5,"College Lily: Oh, it's fruity."
14874,49,3,5,"College Ted: Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong."
14875,49,3,5,"College Lily: So, uh, do you have a girlfriend?"
14876,49,3,5,"College Ted: Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, ""In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know."" You know?"
14877,49,3,5,College Lily: Wow.
14878,49,3,5,(College Ted and College Lily start kissing)
14879,49,3,5,(back to present scene)
14880,49,3,5,"Ted: As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me."
14881,49,3,5,Blah-blah: Oh my God.
14882,49,3,5,"Ted: Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?"
14883,49,3,5,Blah-blah: You have to tell Marshall.
14884,49,3,5,"Ted: If he heard that, it would destroy him."
14885,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: If you don't tell him, I will."
14886,49,3,5,"Ted: Oh, come on, you wouldn't."
14887,49,3,5,(Blah-blah gives Ted a scary look)
14888,49,3,5,Ted: Oh no.
14889,49,3,5,(Blah-blah and Ted walk back over to booth and sit down)
14890,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story."
14891,49,3,5,Ted: I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.
14892,49,3,5,"Lily: Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago."
14893,49,3,5,(flashback to College Ted crying while talking on phone)
14894,49,3,5,"College Ted: I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says."
14895,49,3,5,(College Marshall and College Lily enter room)
14896,49,3,5,"College Ted: In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail."
14897,49,3,5,(College Ted hangs up phone)
14898,49,3,5,"College Marshall: Ted, this is Lily."
14899,49,3,5,"College Ted: No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen."

14901,49,3,5,(back top present scene)
14902,49,3,5,"Ted: Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?"
14903,49,3,5,"Blah-blah: That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em."
14904,49,3,5,Marshall: Tell us what?
14905,49,3,5,"Ted: Lily, will you help us get the next round?"
14906,49,3,5,"(Ted, Blah-blah and Lily walk over to bar)"
14907,49,3,5,"Lily: Ted, what's going on?"
14908,49,3,5,"Ted: She knows about us, about how we really met."
14909,49,3,5,"Lily: Yeah, I know, I just told her."
14910,49,3,5,"Ted: No, the real story."
14911,49,3,5,"Lily: Ted, what are you talking about?"

14914,49,3,5,"Ted: Lily, come on."
14915,49,3,5,"Lily: Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about."
14916,49,3,5,"Ted: Lily, come on."
14917,49,3,5,Blah-blah: I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.
14918,49,3,5,Lily: What? Ted and I never made out.
14919,49,3,5,"Ted: Yeah, we did."
14920,49,3,5,"Lily: I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy."
14921,49,3,5,Ted: What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.
14922,49,3,5,Lily: That wasn't me.
14923,49,3,5,"Ted: Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party."

14926,49,3,5,"Barney: How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times."
14927,49,3,5,Barney: It was right over there.

15393,51,3,7,"Barney: I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab. (He wants to take the wonderbra. Robin grab it from him)."
15394,51,3,7,Ted: Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about?
15395,51,3,7,Robin: I know what they've been fighting...
15396,51,3,7,Ted: bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.
15397,51,3,7,Barney: Ah!
15398,51,3,7,Ted: Lily left the lid off... (Ted put dark sunglasses) and marshall blew heads.
15399,51,3,7,"Robin: I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter."
15400,51,3,7,"Barney: Robin, just..."
15401,51,3,7,"Ted: I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman."
15402,51,3,7,Barney (to Robin): Just...
15403,51,3,7,Robin: They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.
15404,51,3,7,"Barney: Robin, just..."
15405,51,3,7,Ted: What?
15406,51,3,7,"Robin: Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore"
15407,51,3,7,"Ted: Nice try Robin. So, the next thing Lily did was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about the peanut butter. Then she called him to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is... (Ted take the phone and see the last number)"
15408,51,3,7,"Phone Voice: Greenstein and Lee, Divorce Attorneys. (Surprised, Ted throws the phone)"
15409,51,3,7,"[The apartment - Ted, Barney, Robin - They're sitting down the floor of the kitchen and eating ice cream]"
15410,51,3,7,Ted: This can't be happening.
15411,51,3,7,Barney: They can't... get divorced.
15412,51,3,7,"Ted: Not Lily and Marshall, no way."
15413,51,3,7,"Robin: Well, it's been nice knowing you guys."
15414,51,3,7,Ted: What do you mean?
15415,51,3,7,"Robin: Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me."
15416,51,3,7,"Ted: Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird."
15417,51,3,7,Robin: It's a little weird.
15418,51,3,7,"Ted: Yeah, it is. It's weird."
15419,51,3,7,"Barney: The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye."
15420,51,3,7,(keys noise)
15421,51,3,7,Robin: They're back.
15422,51,3,7,(Lily and Marshall come into the room)
15423,51,3,7,"Marshall: Hey, hey guys."
15424,51,3,7,Lily: We have an annoucement.
15425,51,3,7,"Barney (going to cry): I know, it's a terrible idea. You can't do it. Just look at me."
15426,51,3,7,Ted: I hit redial on the phone. Divorce lawyers?
15427,51,3,7,"Lily: Ow, I should explain. We got in a pretty big fight."
15428,51,3,7,"ted: Yeah, I know"
15429,51,3,7,Lily: Marshall stormed out.
15430,51,3,7,"Marshall: I went, uh, to the bar."
15431,51,3,7,"[Flashback: The bar- Marshall drinks the big bottle of champagne, Lily comes to him]"
15432,51,3,7,Lily: Still drinking that?
15433,51,3,7,"Marshall: I paid for it. And apparently money's tight now, so..."
15434,51,3,7,"Lily: Listen, i've been thinking about this, and i know there's no way to undo what i've done, but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer."
15435,51,3,7,Marshall: What?! What?!
15436,51,3,7,"Lily: Oh no no! no, no, no"
15437,51,3,7,Marshall (in the same time): You want a divorce now?
15438,51,3,7,"Lily: No! I just mean on papers, so that you can buy the apartment without my bad credit dragging us down."
15439,51,3,7,Marshall: Lily... are you trying to kill me?
15440,51,3,7,"Lily: I'm sorry, i shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part."
15441,51,3,7,"Marshall: No, you shouldn't have! I love you, Lily."
15442,51,3,7,"Lily: I love you too, and i want us to have our dream home. And well, i don't know, it seems like this is a way to do it. So Marshall Eriksen, will you divorce me?"
15443,51,3,7,Marshall: That's the sweetest divorce proposal i've ever heard.
15444,51,3,7,Lily: So is that a yes? You can't sleep with other women though.
15445,51,3,7,"Marshall: No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. (They kiss, the waitress comes)"
15446,51,3,7,"Wendy, upset, with a black eye: Can i get you guys anything else?"
15447,51,3,7,[End flashback]
15448,51,3,7,Robin: So you're not getting a divorce?
15449,51,3,7,Lily: No!
15450,51,3,7,"Ted: Wow, guys! You scared us."
15451,51,3,7,"Barney: Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold."
15452,51,3,7,Robin: So what's the annoucement?
15453,51,3,7,"Marshall: I just got off the phone with the Realtor. We told her that, uh, because of our finances, we're not getting the place. It's just --it's not the right time."
15454,51,3,7,Narrator: Is what Marshall should have said.
15455,51,3,7,[Rewind] Marshall: I just got off the phone with the Realtor. we got the place!
15456,51,3,7,Lily: We're home on earth!

15458,51,3,7,Narrator: Is what we should have said.
15459,51,3,7,Together: Yeah!! (They hug each other)
15460,51,3,7,[On a cab -Lily/Marshall]
15461,51,3,7,Marshall: Ow this is exciting!

15464,51,3,7,Lily: We shall.
15465,51,3,7,(They go out then come back quickly because of it stinks)
15466,51,3,7,Lily: Oh! what a horrible smell.
15467,51,3,7,Marshall: It reeks!
15468,51,3,7,"Cab driver: Oh, that's just the plant. Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends."
15469,51,3,7,Lily: Wh-what plant? What are you talking about?
15470,51,3,7,"Cab driver: Don't you know? Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind of the sewage treatment plant."
15471,51,3,7,Marshall: Wait... What did you just say?

15476,52,3,8,She convinced you to go jogging?
15477,52,3,8,"Wow, you really want to get in this girl's pants."
15478,52,3,8,"I'm telling you, you guys are gonna love her."
15479,52,3,8,"Lily, she knows all about art."
15480,52,3,8,"Marshall, she's open to the existence of UFOs."
15481,52,3,8,"Barney, she's hot. Robin, she's not hotter than you."
15482,52,3,8,Like her already.
15483,52,3,8,How not hotter?
15484,52,3,8,"So we all went out to dinner, and I couldn't wait to see if my friends were as crazy about Cathy as I was."
15485,52,3,8,"So, what's everyone getting?"
15486,52,3,8,"Well, I can't decide."
15487,52,3,8,"Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?"
15488,52,3,8,Lasagna. Just get the lasagna!
15489,52,3,8,Oh. You guys just got a new place.
15490,52,3,8,How many bedrooms is it?
15491,52,3,8,Two. It's two bedrooms!
15492,52,3,8,Okay! Let's hear it.
15493,52,3,8,What's wrong with Cathy?
15494,52,3,8,"Are you kidding me, Ted?"
15495,52,3,8,She's got a...
15496,52,3,8,Wait! You don't notice it?
15497,52,3,8,Notice what?
15498,52,3,8,"Oh, he doesn't see it."
15499,52,3,8,"If we point it out, we're gonna ruin her for him."
15500,52,3,8,"As his friends, we'll just keep him in the dark."
15501,52,3,8,You're right.
15502,52,3,8,"She's great, man."
15503,52,3,8,She's a keeper. Just... keep her somewhere else.
15504,52,3,8,"Marshall, what is everyone's problem with Cathy?"
15505,52,3,8,"Oh, she's a total nightmare, Ted, but can we talk about this later?"
15506,52,3,8,I'm a minute away from finding out if I'm gonna be a lawyer or not.
15507,52,3,8,"You see, kids, during the summer, Marshall had taken the New York Bar exam. His years of school, his countless hours of study, had finally culminated in this grueling, two-day ordeal."
15508,52,3,8,And... begin.
15509,52,3,8,"The pressure of it was enormous. Every year, people taking the bar simply cracked. But Marshall had made it through."
15510,52,3,8,And...
15511,52,3,8,time.
15512,52,3,8,Time's up.
15513,52,3,8,Right.
15514,52,3,8,Time.
15515,52,3,8,Sir.
15516,52,3,8,I know.
15517,52,3,8,Your time is...
15518,52,3,8,I know it is.
15519,52,3,8,Give me...!
15520,52,3,8,"Now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled to post online at 10:00, and it was 9:59."
15521,52,3,8,"Damn, they're not up yet."
15522,52,3,8,"Oh, don't worry, baby. I'm sure you rocked it."
15523,52,3,8,"I mean, how many people fail the bar?"
15524,52,3,8,Half.
15525,52,3,8,"Oh, my God, half? Only half the people pass?"
15526,52,3,8,"I mean, half the people pass. That's fantastic."
15527,52,3,8,"Go, Marshall."
15528,52,3,8,"Oh, hey, can I jump on there? I want to show you something awesome."
15529,52,3,8,"What? No, no. Bar results. My future."
15530,52,3,8,Trust me. You need to see this.
15531,52,3,8,What is so important that I need to see it right now?
15532,52,3,8,It's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.
15533,52,3,8,How do I need to see that?
15534,52,3,8,Why would I want to see that?
15535,52,3,8,In what possible way could subjecting my eyes and my brain to something that disgusting enrich my life?
15536,52,3,8,It's a dog pooping on a baby.
15537,52,3,8,Get away from my computer.
15538,52,3,8,"Okay, just do a quick Google search for ""caca spaniel."""
15539,52,3,8,The results are in.
15540,52,3,8,Whoo. What's it say?
15541,52,3,8,"""Input password."""
15542,52,3,8,Input the password !
15543,52,3,8,It's okay. They assigned it to me when I took the test.
15544,52,3,8,It's gotta be around here somewhere.
15545,52,3,8,Here. Here-here-here-here.
15546,52,3,8,"Jelly beans, fluffernutter, Gummi Bears, ginger snaps..."

15548,52,3,8,Sugar helps me study.
15549,52,3,8,This is like the shopping a ten-year-old does when his parents leave him alone for the weekend.
15550,52,3,8,What parent leaves a ten-year-old alone for the weekend?
15551,52,3,8,And your mom was perfect.
15552,52,3,8,I can't find my password!
15553,52,3,8,"Okay, just... can't you let 'em know that you lost it and they'll e-mail it to you or something?"
15554,52,3,8,"No! They won't let me do that. I'm gonna have to wait till the results come in the regular mail. That could be weeks from now, if ever!"
15555,52,3,8,Our mail carrier hates me ever since I asked her when the baby was due.
15556,52,3,8,She wasn't pregnant?
15557,52,3,8,"No, he was not."
15558,52,3,8,"Okay, well, that's a drag, but the results will come eventually."
15559,52,3,8,Just try to keep it off your mind until then.
15560,52,3,8,"Hey, Brad."
15561,52,3,8,"Oh, congratulations, man."
15562,52,3,8,"I'm, uh... I'm not sure yet. I..."
15563,52,3,8,lost my password.
15564,52,3,8,"That's great, Cara."
15565,52,3,8,I don't know yet. I lost my password.
15566,52,3,8,I don't know how I lost it!
15567,52,3,8,This stuff happens!
15568,52,3,8,You're one to talk. You misplace stuff all the time.
15569,52,3,8,"I'm sorry. I'm sure the nurses are stealing your medicine, Grandma."
15570,52,3,8,"Love you, too."
15571,52,3,8,"If I have to wait six weeks to find out if I passed, I'm gonna have a heart attack."
15572,52,3,8,"Based on that grocery list, I'd say diabetes is a bigger worry."
15573,52,3,8,You know what? Laugh all you want.
15574,52,3,8,"This affects my whole future, all right?"
15575,52,3,8,Okay. I probably shouldn't be telling you this.
15576,52,3,8,"I definitely shouldn't be telling you this, but there is a way I can help you with your problem."
15577,52,3,8,How?
15578,52,3,8,I know a guy at work.
15579,52,3,8,He can get access to software designed to penetrate firewalls and retrieve passwords through secure servers.
15580,52,3,8,I can get into any computer.
15581,52,3,8,So what do we do?
15582,52,3,8,"Like, arrange a secret meeting in a darkened parking structure?"
15583,52,3,8,No.
15584,52,3,8,Can we?
15585,52,3,8,No.
15586,52,3,8,I have a trench coat.
15587,52,3,8,"Dude, be cool."
15588,52,3,8,"So, I just got off the phone with Cathy."
15589,52,3,8,"God, you guys are so right. I totally hear it now."
15590,52,3,8,See it now?
15591,52,3,8,Smell it?
15592,52,3,8,What is it?!
15593,52,3,8,I left the table for two minutes.
15594,52,3,8,What could she have possibly done in that time that was so horrible?
15595,52,3,8,Was it...
15596,52,3,8,I'll be back in one second.
15597,52,3,8,"One time, in the tenth grade, as a joke, I told everyone that my English teacher had s*x with me."
15598,52,3,8,He's still in jail.
15599,52,3,8,Or maybe...
15600,52,3,8,I'll be back in a second.
15601,52,3,8,So I volunteer at the pound.
15602,52,3,8,"Oh, isn't that nice?"
15603,52,3,8,Yeah.
15604,52,3,8,You can't imagine the rush you get from killing an unwanted puppy.
15605,52,3,8,I make bracelets out of the collars.
15606,52,3,8,Or...
15607,52,3,8,I'll be back in one second.
15608,52,3,8,I bet he's going to the urinal.
15609,52,3,8,Yeah. I remember when I had a pen1s.
15610,52,3,8,It wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.
15611,52,3,8,It's just the way she is.
15612,52,3,8,"I don't get it. If it's so obvious and you guys all see it, how come I don't?"
15613,52,3,8,'Cause we're not trying to have s*x with her.
15614,52,3,8,"Brother, you're driving the ""I want to have s*x with her"" truck, and it's got a huge blind spot."
15615,52,3,8,That's ridiculous.
15616,52,3,8,Is it really?
15617,52,3,8,"Ted, let me tell you a little story about a young lady I wanted to have s*x with..."
15618,52,3,8,Lucilia.
15619,52,3,8,"On a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro, we made love for ten straight hours."
15620,52,3,8,"When we were done, she applauded and told me I was far, far better than the best lover she could possibly imagine, and that I had restored her faith in God."
15621,52,3,8,What does this have to do with Cathy?
15622,52,3,8,Who's Cathy?
15623,52,3,8,Just tell me what the hell is wrong with her already.
15624,52,3,8,Okay. You want to know?
15625,52,3,8,Yes.
15626,52,3,8,You want to shatter this beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?
15627,52,3,8,Fine. Here it is.
15628,52,3,8,Cathy talks...
15629,52,3,8,a lot.
15630,52,3,8,"Oh, come on. That's not true."
15631,52,3,8,"Ted. Really, really think about that dinner we all just had together."
15632,52,3,8,And I did.
15633,52,3,8,"So, what's everyone getting?"
15634,52,3,8,"Well, I can't decide."
15635,52,3,8,"Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?"
15636,52,3,8,"I like chicken. I like lasagna. I like them both, but I really like pork. A lot of people don't eat pork, and maybe it's because of that movie Babe or something."
15637,52,3,8,"But that was funny. He was a talking pig and he was like ""Bah, Ram, Ewe!"""
15638,52,3,8,"What-what if there was a sorority, ""Bah, Ram, Ewe?"""
15639,52,3,8,I'd totally rush it. ...And so I named him Dr. Seuss!
15640,52,3,8,Lorax is a funny word.
15641,52,3,8,Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!
15642,52,3,8,"Oh, you guys just got a new place."
15643,52,3,8,How many bedrooms is it?
15644,52,3,8,"I would love to have an extra bedroom, because I would put a Stairmaster in there."
15645,52,3,8,But you guys should get a convertible sofa.
15646,52,3,8,Or a futon. Futons are great. Or what about one of those Murphy beds?
15647,52,3,8,Who invented the Murphy bed? Was it a guy named Murphy?
15648,52,3,8,"Oh, my God. Do you guys remember that show Murphy Brown?"
15649,52,3,8,That was a funny show. She had a new assistant every episode. ...and it was like half an hour before I realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore! Isn't that hysterical?
15650,52,3,8,Two! It's two bedrooms!
15651,52,3,8,"Hey, do you guys like cannolis?"
15652,52,3,8,"Because I know this place and it's in the South Bronx and you wouldn't expect it, but they have the best cannolis in town."
15653,52,3,8,"And just like that, the illusion was shattered."
15654,52,3,8,"She just never shuts up, does she?"
15655,52,3,8,She didn't stop to swallow her food.
15656,52,3,8,I was scared for her. I didn't want her to choke.
15657,52,3,8,At first.
15658,52,3,8,"So kids, this girls I was dating would not stop talking. Can you imagine how awful that is?"
15659,52,3,8,Do you own a wok?
15660,52,3,8,'Cause that's really how...
15661,52,3,8,Don't you just love autumn?
15662,52,3,8,"Today I'm dressed for... Oh, my God. The sweetest thing."
15663,52,3,8,And I know this great place where we can go.
15664,52,3,8,They have guys and girls clothes. We could both shop at the same time.
15665,52,3,8,And a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...
15666,52,3,8,Hey! Why are you running so fast?
15667,52,3,8,"Well, thank you, pal. You and your little friends, you just had to tell me."
15668,52,3,8,You just had to give in to my incessant begging.
15669,52,3,8,You said that you wanted to know.
15670,52,3,8,I didn't want to know!
15671,52,3,8,You said you wanted to know!
15672,52,3,8,"Well, I didn't know I didn't want to know! You knew."
15673,52,3,8,And you know me. And you should have known I didn't want to know!
15674,52,3,8,You know?
15675,52,3,8,I'm sorry we told you. I'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.
15676,52,3,8,There's only a finite combination of words in the English language.
15677,52,3,8,"Well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer."
15678,52,3,8,She's got all these other great qualities. She's smart.
15679,52,3,8,She's caring. She loves animals...
15680,52,3,8,You know how to teach her a lesson? Buy her a parrot.
15681,52,3,8,"Oh, come on. I'm sorry that we told you, okay?"
15682,52,3,8,It's part of being in a relationship.
15683,52,3,8,"Eventually, you get used to these annoying little things that bug you at first."
15684,52,3,8,"Yeah, I guess."
15685,52,3,8,"I mean, you got used to Lily's loud chewing, right?"
15686,52,3,8,Lily doesn't chew loudly.
15687,52,3,8,Dude... Come on. This isn't news.
15688,52,3,8,"Why do you think I call her ""Chewbacca""?"
15689,52,3,8,"I assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts and I resemble a young Harrison Ford."
15690,52,3,8,Think about it.
15691,52,3,8,"Oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing you've ever done to me."
15692,52,3,8,I really thought you knew.
15693,52,3,8,We had ribs the other night. It sounded like Jurassic Park.
15694,52,3,8,Ha-ha-ha. You know what? It doesn't matter.
15695,52,3,8,But it did.
15696,52,3,8,"Say, what's in that cereal besides dry twigs and small animal bones?"
15697,52,3,8,What's that supposed to mean?
15698,52,3,8,"Lily, I love you, but honest to God, when you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal full of drywall screws."
15699,52,3,8,What's the matter with you?
15700,52,3,8,"We've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?"
15701,52,3,8,"Well, I never noticed it before until..."
15702,52,3,8,Until what?
15703,52,3,8,"Can you believe Ted? What a lame thing to say, that I'm a loud chewer."
15704,52,3,8,"Yeah, that's crazy."
15705,52,3,8,Maybe enough with the pretzels.
15706,52,3,8,"Oh, my God, do I really chew that loudly?"
15707,52,3,8,"No, no, no."
15708,52,3,8,"Okay, now that you pointed it out, maybe it does sound slightly like someone put a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener, but in a cute way."
15709,52,3,8,
15710,52,3,8,"This is all Ted's fault. Oh, like he's so perfect, Mr. Corrector."
15711,52,3,8,What do you mean?
15712,52,3,8,"Oh, come on. You dated the guy for a year and you never noticed that most of what Ted says is correcting you."
15713,52,3,8,"Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?"
15714,52,3,8,"Actually, Kleenex is a brand. This is a facial tissue."
15715,52,3,8,"Oh, my God, is Frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?"
15716,52,3,8,"Uh, Dr. Frankenstein isn't in this scene."
15717,52,3,8,That's Frankenstein's monster.
15718,52,3,8,That literally blew my mind.
15719,52,3,8,Figuratively.
15720,52,3,8,"Oh, my God, you're right."
15721,52,3,8,That is so annoying.
15722,52,3,8,Isn't it?
15723,52,3,8,"Where are those pretzels from, Ace Hardware?"
15724,52,3,8,"Hey, man, you like kettle corn? I'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy."
15725,52,3,8,Are the blinds closed?
15726,52,3,8,I don't know.
15727,52,3,8,Are the blinds closed?!
15728,52,3,8,"Yes, the blinds are closed."
15729,52,3,8,"Good, I didn't think I was followed, but you can never be too sure."
15730,52,3,8,Now double-lock the door and stay away from the windows.
15731,52,3,8,Is there a reason that you're acting like this?
15732,52,3,8,We're about to find out if you're a lawyer.
15733,52,3,8,"Now, in good conscience, I have to inform you that using this software is in violation of the Patriot Act, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the National Security Act of 1948, which created the CIA."
15734,52,3,8,"So I hope you passed the bar because if we use this software, the night janitor Gligor who I fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer, is going to need a good lawyer."
15735,52,3,8,Are you certain you want to go through with this?
15736,52,3,8,"I have to know, yes, yes."
15737,52,3,8,Very good.
15738,52,3,8,"First, we go to the New York State Bar Web site."
15739,52,3,8,"We disable the firewall, then the recursive algorithm grabs your password, and as the application erases itself leaving no trace we were here ever..."
15740,52,3,8,"you ready to see your future, bro?"
15741,52,3,8,Yes.
15742,52,3,8,It's a dog pooping on a baby.
15743,52,3,8,Right! Isn't that awesome?
15744,52,3,8,So you went through all this just to get me to look at your stupid video?
15745,52,3,8,"Yeah, it was worth it."
15746,52,3,8,"Barney, Barney, that was the biggest test of my life."
15747,52,3,8,"I'm incredibly stressed out right now, and I..."
15748,52,3,8,"Okay, that's pretty funny."
15749,52,3,8,You got to see this.
15750,52,3,8,"Yeah, I have to..."
15751,52,3,8,She'll call back when she realizes I'm gone.
15752,52,3,8,Probably in about 45 minutes.
15753,52,3,8,Hey.
15754,52,3,8,Hi.
15755,52,3,8,You guys want a drink?
15756,52,3,8,I'll just have a water.
15757,52,3,8,"Mm, technically, water is a drink."
15758,52,3,8,"Really, Professor? You drink it?"
15759,52,3,8,Is that how water works?
15760,52,3,8,Because I was just gonna smear it on my skin and hope that I absorbed it.
15761,52,3,8,"Or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt."
15762,52,3,8,What's with you?
15763,52,3,8,You're always correcting people.
15764,52,3,8,You totally do that!
15765,52,3,8,That's absolutely right.
15766,52,3,8,"Right? I never noticed it before, and now it's literally driving me crazy."
15767,52,3,8,Figuratively.
15768,52,3,8,"Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse than you using the word ""literally"""
15769,52,3,8,in every other sentence.
15770,52,3,8,Don't they teach vocabulary in Canada?
15771,52,3,8,They literally don't. They literally don't.
15772,52,3,8,"Shut up, Marshall."
15773,52,3,8,That's nothing compared to your thing of singing what you do all the time.
15774,52,3,8,What?
15775,52,3,8,Paying my bills using return address labels From a charity that I haven't given money to Writing a check 'cause now I feel guilty The Salivation Army does not fight fair. Heading down to the basement today With my laundry and a roll of quarters But I'm back too soon 'cause I left the detergent and the fabric softener
15776,52,3,8,Those lines are so sloppy.
15777,52,3,8,"Oh, come on!"
15778,52,3,8,"What about you, ""Barney""?"
15779,52,3,8,"Okay, you..."
15780,52,3,8,always...
15781,52,3,8,"Interesting, interesting, everyone has annoying habits but me."
15782,52,3,8,"Oh, got it."
15783,52,3,8,"Okay, you sometimes talk in a weird high-pitched voice."
15784,52,3,8,And you're constantly using lame catchphrases.
15785,52,3,8,And sometimes you space out and don't even pay attention to what we're talking about.
15786,52,3,8,I'm sorry. What?
15787,52,3,8,"Oh, see? You can't think of anything 'Cause I'm awesome!"
15788,52,3,8,All three right there.
15789,52,3,8,"Well, technically, ""awesome"" wouldn't be a catchphrase."
15790,52,3,8,"If anything, it's more of a catchword."
15791,52,3,8,I literally want to rip your head off.
15792,52,3,8,"You mean ""figuratively""!"
15793,52,3,8,"No, I literally mean ""literally."""
15794,52,3,8,"Literally, literally, literally."
15795,52,3,8,"Oh, my God, Lily, what are you eating, gravel?"
15796,52,3,8,"Oh, I know, right? It sounds like cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner."
15797,52,3,8,"Well, why don't you sing about it?"
15798,52,3,8,Because I don't sing about everything I do.
15799,52,3,8,"No, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense sentences like a stroke victim, and what's worse, they're catchy."
15800,52,3,8,"Apple, orchard, banana, cat dance, 8663"
15801,52,3,8,"See? We know that one because once you sang that for, like, three hours. What the hell is that?"
15802,52,3,8,That's my password.
15803,52,3,8,AOBCD8663.
15804,52,3,8,"Oh, Marshall!"
15805,52,3,8,Awesome!
15806,52,3,8,"There's another one. It's called ""Golden Reliever,"" where this dog..."
15807,52,3,8,"Yeah, we can guess."
15808,52,3,8,"All right, guys, guys, guys."
15809,52,3,8,I'm a lawyer.
15810,52,3,8,And just like that we stopped fighting and celebrated Marshall's success.
15811,52,3,8,"You see, when someone's bad habits are pointed out to you, it's hard to ignore them."
15812,52,3,8,I'm a lawyer now 'cause I passed the bar I'm imposing Marshall law on this champagne.
15813,52,3,8,"Oh my God, are you literally on cloud nine right now?"
15814,52,3,8,"Baby, you never have to take the bar again."
15815,52,3,8,"Actually, if he practices law in another state, he will have to, but New York, man! It's a great state to practice law in!"
15816,52,3,8,Lawsuit up!
15817,52,3,8,"But if you love them enough, those bad habits are easy to forget. Three years later, I ran in to Cathy and she was doing well."
15818,52,3,8,"Ted?! Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in so long! How long has it been?"
15819,52,3,8,"Three years? No, four. No, three, 'cause I went blonde and then I went back 'cause I was having too much fun."
15820,52,3,8,It's true what they say: blondes have more fun.
15821,52,3,8,"Oh, my God, I'm being so rude."
15822,52,3,8,"Ted, this is my fiancé. Yes, I'm engaged."
15823,52,3,8,"Ted, this is Daniel."
15824,52,3,8,Daniel... this is Ted.
15825,52,3,8,"Great, great, nice to meet you."
15826,52,3,8,You guys seem perfect for each other.
15827,52,3,8,"Oh, my God. I know, right? Totally, it was like love at first sight."
15828,52,3,8,"Hey, we should go out sometime. Are you seeing anyone?"
15829,52,3,8,"Because we could double-date. That... ? No, it's not weird."
15830,52,3,8,We can go have brunch out the street. I know this place.
15831,52,3,8,Do you guys like popovers?
15832,52,3,8,Because I love popovers.
15833,52,3,8,"She sur can talk a lot, huh?"
15834,52,3,8,"They're like croissants, but they're a little bit less flaky and they're kind of round."
15835,53,3,9,At the appartment
15836,53,3,9,Ted from 2030: Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.
15837,53,3,9,Barney: No way! March does not have 31 days.
15838,53,3,9,"Marshall: Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge."
15839,53,3,9,Ted & Robin: General knowledge.
15840,53,3,9,Ted from 2030: And we did it all the time.
15841,53,3,9,At the Bar
15842,53,3,9,"Lily: Isn't it sad? I mean in 2007, some countries actually still condone corporal punishment."
15843,53,3,9,Ted & Robin: Corporal punishment.
15844,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: Because once you start, it's surprisingly hard to stop."
15845,53,3,9,"Marshall: Oh, man, I got a kernel stuck in my teeth."
15846,53,3,9,Ted & Robin: Colonel stuck-in-my-teeth.
15847,53,3,9,Please stop! I hate you! You're killing me!
15848,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: But now, we were broken up,so when Marshall said..."
15849,53,3,9,"Marshall: But after the first year,I get a major pay raise."
15850,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: We just let it slide. You see, on the surface, Robin and I looked like we were doing great. But the truth is, trying to be friends with your ex is a lot harder than it looks. You can't be as candid as you used to be."
15851,53,3,9,At the appartment
15852,53,3,9,"Ted: So then this hot intern leans over my desk, I can totally see she has a pierced... (Robin and Lily walk across the room) Brosnan. Pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds."
15853,53,3,9,At the Bar
15854,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together."
15855,53,3,9,"(Barney, Marshall and Lily leave the booth)"
15856,53,3,9,Barney: I gotta go.
15857,53,3,9,Marshall: I'm gonna go pay.
15858,53,3,9,Lily: Peeing.
15859,53,3,9,"(Ted and Robin stays awkwardly at the booth, then...)"
15860,53,3,9,Ted: I'm gonna help marshall pay.
15861,53,3,9,Robin: I'm gonna help lily pee.
15862,53,3,9,[OPENING CREDITS]
15863,53,3,9,At the Bar
15864,53,3,9,(Lily drops a big turkey onto the table)
15865,53,3,9,"Lily: All right,we have a turkey."
15866,53,3,9,"Marshall: Yeah, we do."
15867,53,3,9,Lily: Isn't this exciting? Our first Thanksgiving together as a group.
15868,53,3,9,"Marshall: Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever."
15869,53,3,9,Barney: What?
15870,53,3,9,Marshall: I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.
15871,53,3,9,"Ted: yeah, this is going to be great. Just the five of us, right?"
15872,53,3,9,"Robin: Oh, uh, that reminds me, I invited Bob."
15873,53,3,9,"Lily: Bob? You've been on, like, three dates with that guy. We haven't even met him."
15874,53,3,9,"Robin: Well, he didn't have anywhere else to go, and I didn't know what to say. Is it really that big a deal?"
15875,53,3,9,"Lily: Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, ""Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob."""
15876,53,3,9,"Robin: I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago."
15877,53,3,9,"Barney: I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,""the real Thanksgiving""? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?"
15878,53,3,9,Robin: Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.
15879,53,3,9,Barney: Why are you guys even a country?
15880,53,3,9,"Marshall: Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade."
15881,53,3,9,"Barney: Well, there, you said it again."
15882,53,3,9,Marshall: Said what?
15883,53,3,9,Barney: Slapsgiving.
15884,53,3,9,"Marshall: Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday: Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps."
15885,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third."
15886,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
15887,53,3,9,(There's a countdown on a computer screen)
15888,53,3,9,"Marshall, on the phone with Barney: slapcountdown.com."
15889,53,3,9,Barney: no.
15890,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
15891,53,3,9,"Barney: No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out."
15892,53,3,9,Ted: How many days are in october?
15893,53,3,9,"Barney: Uh, thirty."
15894,53,3,9,"Ted: Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year."
15895,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
15896,53,3,9,"Barney, with a funny accent: I like Halloween very much. Is nice."
15897,53,3,9,Ted: Is also tomorrow.
15898,53,3,9,Barney: Damn it!
15899,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
15900,53,3,9,"Barney: Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?"
15901,53,3,9,Marshall: Slapsgiving.
15902,53,3,9,"Barney: That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?"
15903,53,3,9,"Lily: The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it."
15904,53,3,9,"Barney: Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving..."
15905,53,3,9,Marshall: Slapsgiving.
15906,53,3,9,"Barney:...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared."
15907,53,3,9,Marhall: Really?
15908,53,3,9,"Barney: Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand."
15909,53,3,9,"Marshall: And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand."
15910,53,3,9,"Robin: Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us."
15911,53,3,9,Ted: How old is he?
15912,53,3,9,"Robin: He's forty-one. Hey, bob! Over here!"
15913,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: Okay, kids, the truth is, Bob probably looked like this."
15914,53,3,9,(A fortyish-looking kind of man enters the bar)
15915,53,3,9,"Bob: Hey, sweetie."
15916,53,3,9,Robin: Hi.
15917,53,3,9,Ted from 2030: But when your ex is dating someone new your mind tends to accentuate their flaws. This is how I saw bob.
15918,53,3,9,(Bob looks now like an eighty-years-old man)
15919,53,3,9,"Bob: Hey, dudes,what's crackin'?."
15920,53,3,9,"Ted: Hey, man, how are you?"
15921,53,3,9,Bob: Good to meet you. Sorry I'm late. I just got off the phone with my parents.
15922,53,3,9,Ted: Parents?
15923,53,3,9,"Bob: They were totally on my case: ""What are you gonna do with your life? You're forty-one."" and I'm like, ""Chillax, snowboarding is a legit career. you ought to be stoked I found my bliss."" and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby. ( Robin and Bob kiss)"
15924,53,3,9,Robin: Let's go get a drink.
15925,53,3,9,(Bob and Robin goes away)
15926,53,3,9,Ted: Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.
15927,53,3,9,Lily: What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.
15928,53,3,9,"Marshall: Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass."
15929,53,3,9,"Ted: How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?"
15930,53,3,9,Barney: Nothing but respect for that man.
15931,53,3,9,"Lily: Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight."
15932,53,3,9,"Marshall: For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition."
15933,53,3,9,"Ted: Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?"
15934,53,3,9,Lily: 7:30.
15935,53,3,9,"Ted: Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30."
15936,53,3,9,At Robin's
15937,53,3,9,Ted: Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?
15938,53,3,9,"Robin: Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow."
15939,53,3,9,Ted: Is Bob coming?
15940,53,3,9,"Robin: No, he went to see green day."
15941,53,3,9,Ted: So it's...
15942,53,3,9,Ted and Robin:...just the two of us.
15943,53,3,9,Robin: Making pies.
15944,53,3,9,Ted: Pies. They're things that friends make together.
15945,53,3,9,"Robin: Yeah, they do."
15946,53,3,9,Ted: Great.
15947,53,3,9,Robin: Yeah.
15948,53,3,9,"Ted: Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up."
15949,53,3,9,Robin: Yeah.
15950,53,3,9,"Ted: I'm going to make a phone call. (On the phone with Barney who is at the Bar) Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies."
15951,53,3,9,"Barney: Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely."
15952,53,3,9,"Ted: Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here..."
15953,53,3,9,"Barney: Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening."
15954,53,3,9,"Ted: You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?"
15955,53,3,9,"Barney: No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky."
15956,53,3,9,Ted: So you're not coming to make pies.
15957,53,3,9,"Barney: No, no. Thank you, mr. President. (He hungs up) Sorry."
15958,53,3,9,At the appartment
15959,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays."
15960,53,3,9,"Lily: Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?"
15961,53,3,9,"Marshall: In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face."
15962,53,3,9,"Barney: Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, ""Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness."""
15963,53,3,9,"(Someone is knocking on the door, Ted opens it)"
15964,53,3,9,"Robin: Hey, ted."
15965,53,3,9,"Ted: Hey, happy Thanksgiving."
15966,53,3,9,"Robin: You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?"
15967,53,3,9,Ted: yep.
15968,53,3,9,Robin: Great.
15969,53,3,9,Ted: Marshall?
15970,53,3,9,Robin: Lily?
15971,53,3,9,Ted and Robin: Something really weird happened last night.
15972,53,3,9,Marshall: What do you mean something weird happened last night?
15973,53,3,9,"Ted: You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together."
15974,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
15975,53,3,9,"Ted: So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other."
15976,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
15977,53,3,9,"Ted: I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse."
15978,53,3,9,"Barney: Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain..."
15979,53,3,9,Marshall: You're still getting slapped.
15980,53,3,9,"Ted: I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted."
15981,53,3,9,Robin: I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.
15982,53,3,9,"Lily: Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here."
15983,53,3,9,Robin: I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.
15984,53,3,9,"Lily: Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to."
15985,53,3,9,Robin: And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.
15986,53,3,9,"Lily: Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot."
15987,53,3,9,Robin: He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.
15988,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
15989,53,3,9,"Robin: Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?"
15990,53,3,9,"Ted: Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?"
15991,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
15992,53,3,9,Barney: Ooh. terrible.
15993,53,3,9,Ted: What?! I thought it would break the ice.
15994,53,3,9,Robin: I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.
15995,53,3,9,Lily: How do you respond to something like that?
15996,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
15997,53,3,9,Robin: Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?
15998,53,3,9,"Ted: Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!"
15999,53,3,9,"Robin: Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?"
16000,53,3,9,Ted: Pecan pie? Why are we making that?
16001,53,3,9,"Robin: Um, it's my favorite."
16002,53,3,9,Ted: You're allergic.
16003,53,3,9,Robin: I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.
16004,53,3,9,Ted: So we're making a pie for Bob.
16005,53,3,9,Robin: Yeah.
16006,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
16007,53,3,9,Barney: She's got you making pies for this guy?
16008,53,3,9,Ted: Yeah.
16009,53,3,9,Marshall: That is a real slap in the face.
16010,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
16011,53,3,9,"Ted: You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob."
16012,53,3,9,"Robin: Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you."
16013,53,3,9,Ted: Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?
16014,53,3,9,Robin: I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?
16015,53,3,9,Ted: Yes.
16016,53,3,9,Robin: Why?
16017,53,3,9,Ted: Because he's a thousand years old.
16018,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
16019,53,3,9,"Lily: No, Ted! What are you doing?"
16020,53,3,9,Robin: Right?
16021,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
16022,53,3,9,"Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,"
16023,53,3,9,Robin: Come on.
16024,53,3,9,Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.
16025,53,3,9,Robin: Ted...
16026,53,3,9,"Ted: The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?"
16027,53,3,9,Robin: He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?
16028,53,3,9,Ted: I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.
16029,53,3,9,Robin: It's mean.
16030,53,3,9,"Ted: Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?"
16031,53,3,9,"Robin: First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?"
16032,53,3,9,"Ted: Hey, that is..."
16033,53,3,9,Robin: And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?
16034,53,3,9,"Ted: Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going."
16035,53,3,9,"Robin: Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving."
16036,53,3,9,Ted: I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.
16037,53,3,9,"Robin: I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends."
16038,53,3,9,"Ted: me, too."
16039,53,3,9,(They hug and then kiss)
16040,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
16041,53,3,9,"Lily, Marshall and Barney: You guys slept together last night?"
16042,53,3,9,Lily: That is a terrible idea!
16043,53,3,9,Marshall: Horrible idea.
16044,53,3,9,"Barney: Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!"
16045,53,3,9,Lily: What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...
16046,53,3,9,"Robin: You are correct, Sir."
16047,53,3,9,Lily:...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...
16048,53,3,9,Robin: That is a truth-fact.
16049,53,3,9,Lily:...an event Ted is also attending.
16050,53,3,9,Robin: kablammo.
16051,53,3,9,Lily: Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!
16052,53,3,9,"Robin: Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke."
16053,53,3,9,"Lily: Well, did you guys at least talk about it?"
16054,53,3,9,[FLASHBACK]
16055,53,3,9,Ted:: There's office material...
16056,53,3,9,Robin: I hear something burning...
16057,53,3,9,[END OF FLASHBACK]
16058,53,3,9,"Ted: Clearly, we need to ignore this."
16059,53,3,9,"Robin: Clearly, we need to talk about this."
16060,53,3,9,Ted and Robin: You know? to save the friendship.
16061,53,3,9,Robin: We need to talk.
16062,53,3,9,Ted: Stuffed mushroom?
16063,53,3,9,Robin: We need to talk about last night.
16064,53,3,9,Ted: Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?
16065,53,3,9,"Robin: Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think..."
16066,53,3,9,"Ted: Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?"
16067,53,3,9,Robin: What?! you're crazy!
16068,53,3,9,"Ted: We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck."
16069,53,3,9,Robin: Only because your hand was still around my waist.
16070,53,3,9,"Ted: Oh, come on! You leaned into it."
16071,53,3,9,Robin: I... leaned into it?
16072,53,3,9,"Ted: Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...""Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base."""
16073,53,3,9,"Robin: Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?"
16074,53,3,9,Ted: My on-base percentage was off the charts!
16075,53,3,9,(Ted drops a plate full of appetizers)
16076,53,3,9,"Marshall: Oh, no! The slap-petizers."
16077,53,3,9,"Lily: You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?"
16078,53,3,9,"Barney: Um, most Thanksgivings."
16079,53,3,9,"Marshall: Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing."
16080,53,3,9,"Lily: Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe."
16081,53,3,9,
16082,53,3,9,(The count-down appears on the computer screen)
16083,53,3,9,"Marshall: Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown."
16084,53,3,9,Barney: I'm not scared.
16085,53,3,9,"Marshall: Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum."
16086,53,3,9,Barney: Please don't slap me.
16087,53,3,9,"Marshall: I'm sorry, what?"
16088,53,3,9,"Barney: Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!"
16089,53,3,9,"Marshall: I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?"
16090,53,3,9,"Barney: Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here."
16091,53,3,9,"Marshall: Well, no, no, no. you can't leave."
16092,53,3,9,"Barney: Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!"
16093,53,3,9,Marshall: But it's Slapsgiving.
16094,53,3,9,"Lily: No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!"
16095,53,3,9,Marshall: What?!
16096,53,3,9,Barney: Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!
16097,53,3,9,(Bob arrives)
16098,53,3,9,"Bob: What's up, dudes?"
16099,53,3,9,"All: Hey, bob."
16100,53,3,9,"Marshall: Baby,please... -no!"
16101,53,3,9,"Lily: The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday."
16102,53,3,9,"Bob: Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches."
16103,53,3,9,In Ted's room
16104,53,3,9,"Robin: Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?"
16105,53,3,9,Ted: Apparently not.
16106,53,3,9,Robin: What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.
16107,53,3,9,"Ted: We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to."
16108,53,3,9,"Robin: Well, maybe we should stop pretending."
16109,53,3,9,Ted: Maybe we should.
16110,53,3,9,Robin: So... what do we do now?
16111,53,3,9,Ted: I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.
16112,53,3,9,Robin: Okay.
16113,53,3,9,(Robin leaves the room)
16114,53,3,9,Ted: Happy Thanksgiving.
16115,53,3,9,(Ted leaves the room too)
16116,53,3,9,At diner
16117,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last."
16118,53,3,9,"Barney: Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?"
16119,53,3,9,"Marshall: No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words."
16120,53,3,9,Lily: Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.
16121,53,3,9,"Marshall: Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together."
16122,53,3,9,"Bob: This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming..."
16123,53,3,9,Ted from 2030: And then a funny thing happened...
16124,53,3,9,Bob: It's really a major buzz-kill.
16125,53,3,9,Ted and Robin: Major buzz-kill.
16126,53,3,9,"Lily: Oh, no..."
16127,53,3,9,Barney: I thought we were done with that?
16128,53,3,9,Robin: I guess we're not.
16129,53,3,9,Ted: Guess we're not.
16130,53,3,9,"Ted from 2030: You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving."
16131,53,3,9,"Barney: Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing."
16132,53,3,9,"Lily: Barney, put it away."
16133,53,3,9,"Barney: How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?"
16134,53,3,9,Voice: The slap will occur in ten..
16135,53,3,9,"Barney: Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!"
16136,53,3,9,"Lily: Barney, put it away."
16137,53,3,9,Voice:...six...
16138,53,3,9,Barney: I will in... five...
16139,53,3,9,"Voice:... five, four..."
16140,53,3,9,Lily: You can slap him.
16141,53,3,9,Voice:...three...
16142,53,3,9,"Barney: What?! Wait, you..."
16143,53,3,9,Voice:...two...one.
16144,53,3,9,"(Marshall slaps Barney with all his might, Barney falls down)"
16145,53,3,9,"Marshall: That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights! (Marshall starts playing the piano and singing) *What is this feelin' that's put you in your place a hot, red burnin' on the side of your face you feel the blood rush to your cheek. Tears start to fill your eyes and your lips are tremblin' but you can't speak,you're tryin', oh, you're tryin' not to cry! You just got sla-apped-oh, oh! Across the face, my friend-oh, oh, oh! You just got slapped. Yes, that really just happened. Everybody saw it and everybody laughed and clapped, it was awesome. Wait,you just got... slapped. Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.*"
16146,53,3,9,"Bob is gone, the gang is in the kitchen"
16147,53,3,9,"Lily: Well, guys have fun."
16148,53,3,9,Ted: This is gonna be majoy cleaner.
16149,53,3,9,All: Major cleaner!
16150,53,3,9,"Marshall: Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?"
16151,53,3,9,Robin: That's the general idea.
16152,53,3,9,All: General idea.
16153,54,3,10,"Kids, back to 2007, it seems like everyone belonged to these silly things called gyms. The idea was you'd pay them lots of money to run around and lift heavy things. Biggest rip-off in the world. And yet people fell for it. Including me."
16154,54,3,10,"Oh, hum, forgot my wallet."
16155,54,3,10,It started with one of those moments when you realize you're not as in shape as you want to be.
16156,54,3,10,That's further than it looks.
16157,54,3,10,Coupon's on my dresser.
16158,54,3,10,That's too far. Forget it.
16159,54,3,10,Please don't judge me.
16160,54,3,10,I wound up shame-eating the whole pizza.
16161,54,3,10,I woke up all greasy and sweaty.
16162,54,3,10,My sheets looked like what they wrap deli sandwiches in.
16163,54,3,10,Maybe I should join a gym.
16164,54,3,10,Do you go to a gym?
16165,54,3,10,"Well, I go to Total Rip Fitness, but I don't work out there."
16166,54,3,10,What do you do?
16167,54,3,10,I invest.
16168,54,3,10,There goes one of my investments now.
16169,54,3,10,"Cheryl, hard work's paying off. Keep up the good work."
16170,54,3,10,So your investments... are women?
16171,54,3,10,"Women who, how shall I put this delicately?"
16172,54,3,10,They fat.
16173,54,3,10,"So, I come here, give them lots of attention now."
16174,54,3,10,"Then when they get hot, who's the first guy they run to?"
16175,54,3,10,The one who invested in them when they weren't.
16176,54,3,10,"Wow, I can't decide if I'm thoroughly disgusted or really, really impressed."
16177,54,3,10,"Of course, not all investments pay dividends."
16178,54,3,10,"See the girl over there at the vending machine, Tonya."
16179,54,3,10,She is one Kit Kat away from junk bond status.
16180,54,3,10,"Hey, Barney."
16181,54,3,10,"Becky, elliptical machine's really working for you. Nice stuff."
16182,54,3,10,That one's going to reward shareholders soon.
16183,54,3,10,I foresee aggressive growth in my future.
16184,54,3,10,What up?
16185,54,3,10,"Wow, that makes me want to join a gym."
16186,54,3,10,So I can get super strong and punch you really hard in the face.
16187,54,3,10,"Yes, we should all do it."
16188,54,3,10,"Yeah, let's all punch Barney in the face."
16189,54,3,10,we might as well take it off together.
16190,54,3,10,Or we could just stop drinking beer.
16191,54,3,10,No.
16192,54,3,10,I say we join a gym.
16193,54,3,10,Are you Marshall?
16194,54,3,10,"Hi, I'm Trish. I'm the trainer you signed up for."
16195,54,3,10,"Oh, hi."
16196,54,3,10,"Really great to meet you, Trish."
16197,54,3,10,"It's a pleasure. Marshall, can I talk to you for a second?"
16198,54,3,10,"Yeah, sweetie, I think she is..."
16199,54,3,10,may be just a little too hot to be your trainer.
16200,54,3,10,I get it.
16201,54,3,10,"I mean, I see what you're worried about."
16202,54,3,10,But this is just about me taking care of myself.
16203,54,3,10,You'll always be my sugar.
16204,54,3,10,"So, Marshall, are you ready to make a commitment to your body?"
16205,54,3,10,"Please, I'm all about committing to my body."
16206,54,3,10,I'll drive to Vermont and have a commitment ceremony to my body if you want.
16207,54,3,10,That was a weird thing to say.
16208,54,3,10,All right.
16209,54,3,10,Start with 100 push-ups.
16210,54,3,10,"All right, cool. How many do you want me to do?"
16211,54,3,10,A hundred.
16212,54,3,10,"Oh, I thought that was a figure of speech, 100 push-ups, like, do a bazillion push-ups. No one can do 100."
16213,54,3,10,Do you smell that?
16214,54,3,10,No.
16215,54,3,10,It smells like there's a little bitch in my gym.
16216,54,3,10,Are you being a little bitch in my gym?
16217,54,3,10,No.
16218,54,3,10,Then get on the floor and give me 100!
16219,54,3,10,You don't have to yell at me.
16220,54,3,10,I love it here.
16221,54,3,10,It's just normal women who want to get in shape.
16222,54,3,10,"I don't have to put on makeup, do my hair, wear some trendy outfit."
16223,54,3,10,"Yeah, this place is great. We're meeting our friend Robin here."
16224,54,3,10,I hope you don't hate her. She's pretty hot.
16225,54,3,10,Shut up.
16226,54,3,10,"Lily, tell him to shut up."
16227,54,3,10,"I'm sorry, lesbian prison guard, do we know each other?"
16228,54,3,10,"Ted, Lily, you'll never believe what just happened."
16229,54,3,10,"Oh, hey, dude, I'm Barney."
16230,54,3,10,So I was at the smoothie bar...
16231,54,3,10,What can I get you?
16232,54,3,10,"Oh, my God, Rhonda?"
16233,54,3,10,It's Barney.
16234,54,3,10,Barney Stinson from Staten Island Boulevard.
16235,54,3,10,"Hey, Barney Stinson from Staten Island Boulevard. What can I get you?"
16236,54,3,10,I can't believe she didn't remember me.
16237,54,3,10,Why? Who is she?
16238,54,3,10,That's Rhonda.
16239,54,3,10,I lost my virginity to her.
16240,54,3,10,"Baby, are you still sore?"
16241,54,3,10,"Trish made me do 70 push-ups, but she only gave me credit for ten."
16242,54,3,10,"Then she had me do 100 sit-ups and then she made me cry, using only her words."
16243,54,3,10,It just doesn't add up.
16244,54,3,10,How could Rhonda not remember me?
16245,54,3,10,"Well, maybe it wasn't that good for her. I mean, it was your first time."
16246,54,3,10,"Ted, it's me."
16247,54,3,10,I rocked her world.
16248,54,3,10,"You don't believe me? Okay, story time."
16249,54,3,10,The year was 1998.
16250,54,3,10,I'd been going out with Shannon since freshman year of college.
16251,54,3,10,We were saving ourselves.
16252,54,3,10,"So when we broke up there I was, 23 and still a virgin."
16253,54,3,10,I knew nothing about girls.
16254,54,3,10,So I went to the guy who knew everything about girls my brother James.
16255,54,3,10,"Wait, your gay brother James?"
16256,54,3,10,"Yeah, this was before he was gay."
16257,54,3,10,"Barney... Barney, you need to find a girl and have s*x with her ASAP."
16258,54,3,10,That is what dudes do after a breakup.
16259,54,3,10,"I know. I want to, but..."
16260,54,3,10,I guess I'm just scared.
16261,54,3,10,Of course you're scared. It's gross.
16262,54,3,10,The thought of doing that with a woman...
16263,54,3,10,But it's part of being a guy.
16264,54,3,10,Try thinking about baseball.
16265,54,3,10,Somehow I imagine those players on the field and it's over a lot faster.
16266,54,3,10,But I don't know the first thing about seducing a woman.
16267,54,3,10,What do you...? How do you...? Where do you...?
16268,54,3,10,Stop. Don't overthink it.
16269,54,3,10,You don't want to get the yips.
16270,54,3,10,The yips?
16271,54,3,10,"Yeah, when you overthink simple things so much that you can't do them at all."
16272,54,3,10,The yips.
16273,54,3,10,"Yeah, it happens to athletes all the time."
16274,54,3,10,Like the second baseman who suddenly can't throw to first or the figure skater who does a perfect triple toe loop and then loses it on the arabesque.
16275,54,3,10,I've actually really been getting into figure skating lately.
16276,54,3,10,"But, James..."
16277,54,3,10,what woman's going to have s*x with me?
16278,54,3,10,It's not like I'm a Backstreet Boy.
16279,54,3,10,The Man Maker.
16280,54,3,10,"Rhonda ""Man Maker"" French was our mom's friend from down the street."
16281,54,3,10,Got any kings?
16282,54,3,10,Go fish.
16283,54,3,10,"So, Patty, know that new paperboy?"
16284,54,3,10,"I let him throw one into my hedges, if you know what I mean."
16285,54,3,10,Did you see that new guy who cleans my pool?
16286,54,3,10,"I let him snake my drain, if you know what I mean."
16287,54,3,10,You know that Chinese food delivery boy?
16288,54,3,10,I had s*x with him.
16289,54,3,10,I don't have a funny way of saying it yet. It just happened 20 minutes ago.
16290,54,3,10,Of course.
16291,54,3,10,The Man Maker.
16292,54,3,10,"And it'll be easier too, 'cause she knows me so well."
16293,54,3,10,"Hi, Barry."
16294,54,3,10,Barney.
16295,54,3,10,"Hi, Ms. French. I know we haven't seen each other for a while, but if there was any chance... Oh, boy."
16296,54,3,10,You just rocked my world.
16297,54,3,10,That was the best s*x I ever had.
16298,54,3,10,That was the night I was born.
16299,54,3,10,"I rose like a phoenix from her mentholated bosom and strode into the world, Armani clad and fully awesome."
16300,54,3,10,"God, please let me stop!"
16301,54,3,10,"Yes, great, let's stop. Let's just kick back and wait for the massive coronary you're going to have a couple years from now when you're 40."
16302,54,3,10,I'm... I'm 29.
16303,54,3,10,50 more!
16304,54,3,10,"Hi, sweetie."
16305,54,3,10,"I got a trainer, too. This is Max."
16306,54,3,10,We're going to focus on flexibility.
16307,54,3,10,"Yeah, I'm gonna stretch her out."
16308,54,3,10,"Great... Wait, what?"
16309,54,3,10,"50 more, now!"
16310,54,3,10,"Okay, well, that's not cool."
16311,54,3,10,"You know, Rhonda, running into you really got me thinking about the old days."
16312,54,3,10,You were quite popular.
16313,54,3,10,I sure got around back then.
16314,54,3,10,And there was one young man who stood out above the pack.
16315,54,3,10,Freddy Chibatoni. That kid had a tongue like a gecko.
16316,54,3,10,"No, no, I was thinking about someone else."
16317,54,3,10,"Chaz Alderman. Hips like a woman, but he knew how to use them."
16318,54,3,10,What about me?!
16319,54,3,10,You?
16320,54,3,10,Yes. We slept together.
16321,54,3,10,And you said I was the best you ever had.
16322,54,3,10,Did I?
16323,54,3,10,"Oh, right."
16324,54,3,10,About that...
16325,54,3,10,And tell him that he's the best you ever had.
16326,54,3,10,"Oh, I don't know."
16327,54,3,10,He's just a kid.
16328,54,3,10,"No he isn't. He's 23 and he is really hurting, Rhonda."
16329,54,3,10,Please.
16330,54,3,10,Maybe we could make a deal.
16331,54,3,10,What?
16332,54,3,10,"No, girl, I got a girlfriend."
16333,54,3,10,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, hers is the only vagina for me."
16334,54,3,10,Oh... I love it.
16335,54,3,10,It... it isn't scary at all.
16336,54,3,10,"Well, too bad. I guess your brother's going to stay a virgin."
16337,54,3,10,Fine.
16338,54,3,10,
16339,54,3,10,"Reggie Jackson, Reggie Jackson, Reggie Jackson..."
16340,54,3,10,But those compliments you gave me.
16341,54,3,10,You just rocked my world.
16342,54,3,10,That was the best s*x I ever had.
16343,54,3,10,But you said I rocked your world.
16344,54,3,10,All subsequent worlds that I rocked were only so rocked because of the confidence I earned from said first world rocking.
16345,54,3,10,"Sorry, Barry."
16346,54,3,10,It's Barney.
16347,54,3,10,"So I'm doing sit-ups and she says, ""All right, Marshall, just one more set."""
16348,54,3,10,"So I summon all my strength and I do that set, and then she says, ""Give me another set."""
16349,54,3,10,"So I'm like, ""Is this the last set?"""
16350,54,3,10,"And she says yes. So I do that set and then she says, ""Give me another set."" She lied to my face!"
16351,54,3,10,Everything hurts.
16352,54,3,10,"Baby, the whole point of working out is to feel better."
16353,54,3,10,This trainer is making you miserable. You have to call her and quit.
16354,54,3,10,I got to work through it. I got to finish what I started.
16355,54,3,10,"If you're too scared, I can call her."
16356,54,3,10,Her number's on this card.
16357,54,3,10,Hi. Is this Trish?
16358,54,3,10,"This is Marshall's wife. Listen, we have a problem here and it's you."
16359,54,3,10,"I don't know who the hell you think you are, but from now on, you don't tell Marshall what to do."
16360,54,3,10,You are an employee. We tell you what to do.
16361,54,3,10,"And I'm telling you you're fired, bitch."
16362,54,3,10,"Okay, bye. You better get down there, baby. She's pretty pissed."
16363,54,3,10,"Hey, buddy. Still bummed about the whole Rhonda thing?"
16364,54,3,10,No. Why would I let the approval of one woman define who I am?
16365,54,3,10,"That's very mature of you, Barney."
16366,54,3,10,Let him finish.
16367,54,3,10,When I can let the approval of a gaggle of supermodels define who I am. What? What?
16368,54,3,10,Three tickets to the after party of the Victoria's Secret fashion show?
16369,54,3,10,"Uh, kablammie!"
16370,54,3,10,"Lily, um, could I go?"
16371,54,3,10,Go. You're too sore to do anything anyway.
16372,54,3,10,"Okay, this, boys, is not a regular season game."
16373,54,3,10,This is the World Series.
16374,54,3,10,"So remember, we work together."
16375,54,3,10,We're a team. And if anyone sees Heidi Klum... dibs.
16376,54,3,10,Target acquired. Dig deep.
16377,54,3,10,"Hey, it's a nice party, huh?"
16378,54,3,10,"Yeah, it's great."
16379,54,3,10,Do you guys work for the company?
16380,54,3,10,"Yeah, it's called ""I'm Gonna Get In Your Panties, Incorporated."""
16381,54,3,10,Gross!
16382,54,3,10,Dude!
16383,54,3,10,I don't know. That was terrible. I am so sorry.
16384,54,3,10,Wait a minute. It's okay. It's okay. It's fine.
16385,54,3,10,It's a numbers game. I'm cool.
16386,54,3,10,Model... model.
16387,54,3,10,Hi.
16388,54,3,10,"I know, right?"
16389,54,3,10,This party is legend- Wait for it...
16390,54,3,10,"Uh, how long do we have to wait for it?"
16391,54,3,10,I think he's having a stroke.
16392,54,3,10,What is the matter with me?
16393,54,3,10,I don't know.
16394,54,3,10,"Wait, wait, wait... you don't think I have the yips, do ya?"
16395,54,3,10,"No, no, no, relax."
16396,54,3,10,There's Alessandra Ambrosio. English is her second language.
16397,54,3,10,"Even if you screw up, you'll never know."
16398,54,3,10,Come on.
16399,54,3,10,Hi.
16400,54,3,10,Hi.
16401,54,3,10,Those are very nice honkers.
16402,54,3,10,Honkers?
16403,54,3,10,I don't know this word. Do you want to go dance?
16404,54,3,10,I'm talking about those things. Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!
16405,54,3,10,"Oh, no, I can't have the yips. I can't have the yips, not here. Not now."
16406,54,3,10,"This is me. It's Barney, Barney!"
16407,54,3,10,Heidi Klum!
16408,54,3,10,This is perfect. I can do this. I can do this.
16409,54,3,10,"Thanks for coming. Heidi Klum, I'm Barney."
16410,54,3,10,"Hi, Barney. Nice to meet you."
16411,54,3,10,"Goobidy, goobidy, goobidy, goobidy."
16412,54,3,10,Is he okay?
16413,54,3,10,"Uh, he has the yips."
16414,54,3,10,Hasn't been able to hit on a woman all night.
16415,54,3,10,He has the yips?
16416,54,3,10,"Ooh, that's bad."
16417,54,3,10,"You know, in Germany, we call this #@%!. Whoa, that is bad."
16418,54,3,10,"I don't know what's happened to me. I've, I've totally lost my confidence."
16419,54,3,10,"Barney, maybe you have to open up to somebody."
16420,54,3,10,Maybe you have to open up to some...
16421,54,3,10,He just found out that the woman he lost his virginity to only did it because his brother bribed her.
16422,54,3,10,That's a rough one.
16423,54,3,10,"I mean, the only thing I can think of to get rid of #@%! is you have to go out there. And you need to find that woman."
16424,54,3,10,And you need to earn it with her for real.
16425,54,3,10,That is the only way how you can find yourself.
16426,54,3,10,I see little hamburgers! I love little hamburgers.
16427,54,3,10,Wiedersehen.
16428,54,3,10,I just made out with Heidi Klum.
16429,54,3,10,What?
16430,54,3,10,"Ted, just... okay?"
16431,54,3,10,Come in.
16432,54,3,10,"Hi, Rhonda."
16433,54,3,10,"Hi, kiddo. Surprised to see you here."
16434,54,3,10,"So, hey, uh, maybe how about s*x?"
16435,54,3,10,Let's s*x.
16436,54,3,10,What are you talking about? I'm watching Wheel of Fortune.
16437,54,3,10,You can keep watching. I'll face you toward the TV.
16438,54,3,10,"That's a cute idea, kid."
16439,54,3,10,Great.
16440,54,3,10,"No, I'm not having s*x with you. Sit down a minute."
16441,54,3,10,I'm not the Man Maker anymore. You know what?
16442,54,3,10,"About five years ago, I realized there was an emptiness inside of me that no amount of meaningless s*x could fill."
16443,54,3,10,I needed something more.
16444,54,3,10,And that's when I discovered Indian casinos.
16445,54,3,10,"Hey, Barney, it's weird not seeing you in a suit. What's going on?"
16446,54,3,10,"Uh, not much."
16447,54,3,10,My entire sexual history was built on a rotting foundation of lies.
16448,54,3,10,My whole identity is lost in a pit of menthol ashes.
16449,54,3,10,Work is good.
16450,54,3,10,I'm never going back to that gym again.
16451,54,3,10,"Today at work, I had to have an intern rip up my bagel and put little pieces in my mouth."
16452,54,3,10,"Yeah, I'm done there, too. That place is horrible."
16453,54,3,10,What about your big muscular trainer who's so into stretching you out?
16454,54,3,10,"Yeah, well, turns out that guy had no affiliation with the gym whatsoever."
16455,54,3,10,"Come on, guys, don't give up on the gym."
16456,54,3,10,It's been great for us.
16457,54,3,10,"Like today, Robin and I had a really nice moment."
16458,54,3,10,"Oh, God! Oh... Yahhh!"
16459,54,3,10,"Robin, hey, I just wanted to..."
16460,54,3,10,come over and thank you.
16461,54,3,10,Thank me for what?
16462,54,3,10,"Well, you know how it's hard for exes to be friends because there's this lingering sexual tension between them?"
16463,54,3,10,Gone. Thank you.
16464,54,3,10,"You know, for all the crap you've given me, I haven't seen you work up a sweat there once."
16465,54,3,10,It's not true. I was there today.
16466,54,3,10,"Yeah, but didn't you leave early?"
16467,54,3,10,"Oh, great."
16468,54,3,10,Now I got to go home and charge this.
16469,54,3,10,Wait a minute.
16470,54,3,10,You didn't work out Tuesday either.
16471,54,3,10,Brought the wrong shorts.
16472,54,3,10,"Yeah, and you totally disappeared on Monday, too."
16473,54,3,10,"No, I was at the gym the whole time."
16474,54,3,10,"Ooh! Oh, I love this gym."
16475,54,3,10,"Lily, help me bend down these three fingers."
16476,54,3,10,"Actually, I have an idea."
16477,54,3,10,"Do it! Come on! Do it, you worthless piece of crap!"
16478,54,3,10,"Please! Please, I just want to go home."
16479,54,3,10,Come on. This is your last set!
16480,54,3,10,You said that last time!
16481,54,3,10,Gone.
16482,54,3,10,I saw your friend Ted at the gym.
16483,54,3,10,"After he puked and cleared the line at the smoothie bar, he said you were kinda having a tough time."
16484,54,3,10,"Did you change your mind about having love, making s*x, pen1s vagina? What is the matter with me?"
16485,54,3,10,"Oh, honey..."
16486,54,3,10,"I just, I don't get it."
16487,54,3,10,You slept with so many guys. You slept with my brother.
16488,54,3,10,We are practically the same person. Was I really so bad?
16489,54,3,10,Nobody's good the first time.

16748,55,3,11,Robin: So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.
16749,55,3,11,Marshall: Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.

16758,55,3,11,"Robin: Uh, well, their perimeter shooting has been a little bit off this season..."
16759,55,3,11,"Curt: The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt. So they didn't even try. Well, you know what i think? I think the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with. Kincks suck! (He gets out, on tears)"

16933,56,3,12,"Ted, I'm gonna be honest."
16934,56,3,12,I was full of it with that whole Nostradamus thing.
16935,56,3,12,No.
16936,56,3,12,But I am starting to think there is some serious planetary crap going on here tonight.

16950,56,3,12,It was only weird on the subway.
16951,56,3,12,Oh. I'm gonna check the other rooms to see if the previous owners left us any free stuff.

16988,56,3,12,But it's gonna be an uphill battle.

17002,56,3,12,"All right, I'm gonna try something, and if this works..."
17003,56,3,12,"Uh, hey."
17004,56,3,12,"Hey, what can I get you guys?"
17005,56,3,12,"A bottle of Dom Perignon, and can you put it on my tab?"
17006,56,3,12,Sure. What's the name?
17007,56,3,12,Garrido.
17008,56,3,12,Dude!
17009,56,3,12,"Oh, uh, yeah, you're right. Uh, make it two bottles."
17010,56,3,12,Two.
17011,56,3,12,"Now we wait, see if something good happens..."
17012,56,3,12,
17013,56,3,12,Oh! Hello!
17014,56,3,12,St. Patrick's Day tradition.
17015,56,3,12,"If you're not wearing green, you got to get pinched."
17016,56,3,12,"Well, I guess I got what I deserved."
17017,56,3,12,"I'm not wearing green, either."
17018,56,3,12,"This is, um, deep teal."
17019,56,3,12,The lighting makes it...
17020,56,3,12,"Uh, I'm Ted."
17021,56,3,12,"Ashlee with two ""e""s."
17022,56,3,12,"Please. ""C""s at most."
17023,56,3,12,"You know, you guys should come join me and my friends."
17024,56,3,12,We have a bottle of tequila and shockingly deep belly buttons.
17025,56,3,12,"Okay, it's official: do bad things, good things happen."
17026,56,3,12,"Ted, listen."
17027,56,3,12,Are you hearing that? That's the universe.
17028,56,3,12,The universe is talking to us.
17029,56,3,12,"We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?"
17030,56,3,12,No. The universe is telling us that we have a free pass tonight.
17031,56,3,12,The universe is saying that we don't have to live in fear of the...
17032,56,3,12,Are you still there?
17033,56,3,12,"Yeah, I'm here."
17034,56,3,12,...of the repercussions of our actions.
17035,56,3,12,"There is no waiting for tomorrow, because do you know why, Ted?"
17036,56,3,12,There is no tomorrow.
17037,56,3,12,"No tomorrow, huh?"
17038,56,3,12,"By the way, Mr. Garrido, second bottle of champagne gets you a complimentary ounce of caviar."
17039,56,3,12,Enjoy.
17040,56,3,12,No tomorrow!
17041,56,3,12,No tomorrow!
17042,56,3,12,No tomorrow!
17043,56,3,12,"Hey, I wonder what the grown-ups are doing right now."
17044,56,3,12,I win again.
17045,56,3,12,Why do I keep winning?
17046,56,3,12,Maybe your hippo is just hungrier hungrier than ours.
17047,56,3,12,That's it.
17048,56,3,12,"That's what it is. It's not gravity, that's for sure. I'll tell you that."
17049,56,3,12,What was that?
17050,56,3,12,What's going on here?
17051,56,3,12,"Okay, Lily..."
17052,56,3,12,"while you were in the other room, Robin and I, we discovered something about the apartment."
17053,56,3,12,It's not a big deal.
17054,56,3,12,It's not like a disaster. It's just...
17055,56,3,12,It's something that we're going to have to learn to live with.
17056,56,3,12,Robin and I saw a ghost.
17057,56,3,12,What?
17058,56,3,12,"Oh, he's kidding, right?"
17059,56,3,12,"No, we really saw a ghost."
17060,56,3,12,What did it look like?
17061,56,3,12,"Uh, a sheet with two holes in it."
17062,56,3,12,"He was a Confederate general who was wounded at the Battle of Antietam, and he died at the army hospital which once stood on this very spot."
17063,56,3,12,"And now he wanders these halls, vowing revenge against the Union cannonade hat once felled him."
17064,56,3,12,But he seems nice. He's a good-good guy.
17065,56,3,12,"Marshall, you see ghosts everywhere. You see ghosts at Stars Bucks."
17066,56,3,12,That Kenny G holiday CD just flew off the shelf.
17067,56,3,12,Last time that happened.
17068,56,3,12,"But, Robin, you're a skeptic, so if you say you saw a ghost..."
17069,56,3,12,"It passed right through me, and suddenly I felt cold, so very cold."
17070,56,3,12,"You know, Ashlee, I'm sorry."
17071,56,3,12,"You're probably just gonna want to get up and walk away, but I just have to test out this theory I've been working on."
17072,56,3,12,"Tonight, I am not looking for a relationship."
17073,56,3,12,"I really just want to hook up with you, leave before breakfast, and never see you again."
17074,56,3,12,I'm in.
17075,56,3,12,Unbelievable.
17076,56,3,12,"Hot damn, that's a deep navel."
17077,56,3,12,"No tomorrow, Ted."
17078,56,3,12,"Yeah, no tomorrow, Barney."
17079,56,3,12,"No tomorrow, huh?"
17080,56,3,12,I like that idea.
17081,56,3,12,"Because if there is a tomorrow, I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble."
17082,56,3,12,"Oh, yeah? Why is that?"
17083,56,3,12,I'm married.
17084,56,3,12,"Tell me you're messing with me, guys."
17085,56,3,12,You didn't actually see a ghost.
17086,56,3,12,"It's not a big deal, baby. He seemed friendly."
17087,56,3,12,You said he's a Confederate general. They're the bad guys.
17088,56,3,12,And he's probably racist.
17089,56,3,12,"No, he seemed polite."
17090,56,3,12,He had courtly Southern manners.
17091,56,3,12,We're gonna raise our kids here.
17092,56,3,12,I don't want some Confederate general ghost teaching them his racism.
17093,56,3,12,He loves people of all colors and creeds.
17094,56,3,12,"He was fighting for states' rights, that's all."
17095,56,3,12,Robin said he was wearing a sheet.
17096,56,3,12,What do you think that means?
17097,56,3,12,The apartment is crooked.
17098,56,3,12,What?
17099,56,3,12,Robin and I didn't see a ghost.
17100,56,3,12,"The floor is crooked, isn't it?"
17101,56,3,12,Yeah.
17102,56,3,12,We spent our entire life's savings on this floor.
17103,56,3,12,"The next 30 mortgage-paying years of our lives will be spent on this floor, and it's crooked."
17104,56,3,12,"Thanks a lot, Robin."
17105,56,3,12,"How is ""racist ghost"" better than ""crooked""?"
17106,56,3,12,"Seriously, somebody tell me how that's better."
17107,56,3,12,"Oh, I'm sorry."
17108,56,3,12,"Oh, that's okay."
17109,56,3,12,"Um, dude, so, I'm having second thoughts about that theory."
17110,56,3,12,"I'm telling you, if you want to know how old a woman is, check her elbows."
17111,56,3,12,Not that theory.
17112,56,3,12,"You have to be more specific, Ted, 'cause I have so many theories."
17113,56,3,12,"The whole do bad, good things happen..."
17114,56,3,12,Ashlee is married.
17115,56,3,12,So?
17116,56,3,12,"What do you mean, so?"
17117,56,3,12,"Open your brain tank, brah, 'cause here comes some premium 91 octane knowledge."
17118,56,3,12,There's three rules of cheating:
17119,56,3,12,"It's not cheating if you're not the one who's married, it's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels, and it's not cheating if she's from a different area code."
17120,56,3,12,You're fine on all three counts.
17121,56,3,12,How do you know she's from a different area code?
17122,56,3,12,She's 516.
17123,56,3,12,"She might dress like she's 718, act like she's 212, but trust me, she's 516."
17124,56,3,12,"Oh, and her husband..."
17125,56,3,12,letting her out alone on Saint Patty's Day?
17126,56,3,12,"If that dude's not 973, I'm 307."
17127,56,3,12,Wyoming.
17128,56,3,12,We're gonna have to nail down all our furniture.
17129,56,3,12,We won't be able to get a pinball machine.
17130,56,3,12,"I mean, unless we put some books under two of the legs or something."
17131,56,3,12,But then what if we want to read those books?
17132,56,3,12,This is a nightmare.
17133,56,3,12,We can't raise our kids here. They'll grow up slanted.
17134,56,3,12,"If we have a daughter, we'll have to call her Eileen."
17135,56,3,12,"I don't think we can live here, Marshall."
17136,56,3,12,I don't know what we're gonna do.
17137,56,3,12,Marshall?
17138,56,3,12,Open the door.
17139,56,3,12,"If I make it through the door, that's five points."
17140,56,3,12,Woo-hoo!
17141,56,3,12,Yeah!
17142,56,3,12,Five points.
17143,56,3,12,Ten bucks says I can do it backwards.
17144,56,3,12,So Lily and Marshall decided to make the best of a bad situation. And that's also how the sport of Apartment Roller Luge was invented.
17145,56,3,12,Very careful baby! Oh yeah!
17146,56,3,12,So she's married? It's not like she has kids.
17147,56,3,12,How do you know?
17148,56,3,12,Wrists.
17149,56,3,12,It's like you don't even listen to me.
17150,56,3,12,"Oh, hey."
17151,56,3,12,Hey.
17152,56,3,12,Where'd you go?
17153,56,3,12,"Well, I just, um..."
17154,56,3,12,Was it something I said?
17155,56,3,12,"No, no, no, it's just, well..."
17156,56,3,12,"you're married and-and we've been drinking, and I was worried we might..."
17157,56,3,12,"Oh, this is a very bad idea."
17158,56,3,12,We have a problem.
17159,56,3,12,"Hey, hey. Hey."
17160,56,3,12,Hey.
17161,56,3,12,Is this your husband?
17162,56,3,12,I've never seen this man in my life.
17163,56,3,12,"Oh, okay. Uh, what's our problem?"
17164,56,3,12,Rick. Rick Garrido.
17165,56,3,12,"According to the bartender, I'm the guy that's been buying you champagne all night."
17166,56,3,12,"Okay, there's-there's a very simple explana..."
17167,56,3,12,"Next thing I know the police show up, they arrest the other guy, and I'm drinking for free the rest of the night."
17168,56,3,12,It was awesome.
17169,56,3,12,"Awesome, huh?"
17170,56,3,12,Yeah.
17171,56,3,12,You don't see anything wrong with that story?
17172,56,3,12,"Well, I lost my new phone back at the club somewhere."
17173,56,3,12,"What the hell is wrong with you, dude?"
17174,56,3,12,"You know me, I lose things."
17175,56,3,12,"You kissed a married woman, Ted."
17176,56,3,12,You committed credit card fraud.
17177,56,3,12,You... you kissed a married woman. Do you know how offensive that is to me?
17178,56,3,12,You're turning into Barney.
17179,56,3,12,We don't need another Barney.
17180,56,3,12,Look... it's Saint Patty's Day.
17181,56,3,12,It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
17182,56,3,12,"""It wasn't as bad as it sounds""?"
17183,56,3,12,No.
17184,56,3,12,Huh? Okay...
17185,56,3,12,"I want you to hear exactly how it sounds, Ted."
17186,56,3,12,First skipped message: I don't see no ring on this finger.
17187,56,3,12,And then last night started coming back to me:
17188,56,3,12,The real version.
17189,56,3,12,Are the girls in there hotter than our dates ?
17190,56,3,12,"I don't know if they're hotter, but they're drunker."
17191,56,3,12,Rock 'n' roll.
17192,56,3,12,How many messages did I...
17193,56,3,12,Seventeen...
17194,56,3,12,"Kids, it's sometimes possible to think you're doing just fine in life..."
17195,56,3,12,Next message: Can you put it on my tab?
17196,56,3,12,"Sure, what's the last name?"
17197,56,3,12,Garrido.
17198,56,3,12,"...and then someone opens your eyes a little bit, and you realize..."
17199,56,3,12,"Next message: I really want to hook up with you, leave before breakfast, and then never see you again."
17200,56,3,12,...your whole world is off balance...
17201,56,3,12,Next message: ...out of whack...
17202,56,3,12,"Okay, look, brah, there is a very simple explana..."
17203,56,3,12,...crooked.
17204,56,3,12,That was hard to listen to.
17205,56,3,12,No one likes how they sound on an answering machine.
17206,56,3,12,Thanks for doing that.
17207,56,3,12,You yelled at me.
17208,56,3,12,You got very firm with me.
17209,56,3,12,Very confident.
17210,56,3,12,It was cool.
17211,56,3,12,Thanks.
17212,56,3,12,"You're very sexy when you yell, Marshall."
17213,56,3,12,Shut up.
17214,56,3,12,"Veins, crazy muscles in your neck."
17215,56,3,12,You look like a Kentucky Derby-winning steed.
17216,56,3,12,You're ruining a nice moment.
17217,56,3,12,"At one point, I swear, I thought we were gonna kiss."
17218,56,3,12,"Ted, seriously."
17219,56,3,12,I'm married.
17220,56,3,12,Oh... a slanted floor.
17221,56,3,12,"Architecturally speaking, fixing that's going to be..."
17222,56,3,12,"Very, very, very expensive."
17223,56,3,12,"And it's gonna take some time, too, so it looks like you're stuck with us for a little while longer, if that's okay."
17224,56,3,12,Are you kidding?
17225,56,3,12,I love it.
17226,56,3,12,I don't know what's gonna happen to me without you guys around.
17227,56,3,12,Where are you going?
17228,56,3,12,I'm going to get my stupid phone.
17229,56,3,12,"So that was Saint Patrick's Day, 2008."
17230,56,3,12,I found out years later that your mom was at that party.
17231,56,3,12,I just didn't meet her.
17232,56,3,12,"And it's a good thing I didn't, 'cause if I had met her, I don't think she would have liked me."
17233,56,3,12,"Heck, I don't think I liked me."
17234,56,3,12,But that's okay.
17235,56,3,12,Tomorrow had arrived.
17236,56,3,12,"? Leave me alone, and there'll be ?? No one to get hurt ?"
17237,56,3,12,? Nobody move and there'll be Nothin' to disturb ?? The sum of it all is that you Don't know where to turn ?
17238,56,3,12,? Despite all your promises you Don't keep what you learn ?
17239,56,3,12,"You see, I didn't know it yet, but my luck was about to change."
17240,56,3,12,? Beautiful beat get me out of this mess ?
17241,57,3,13,Ted is waiting for his turn in the tattoo removal center.
17242,57,3,13,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes in life you see someone and you just instantly know this is the person for you. It can happen anywhere. Even the waiting room of a tattoo removal clinic. And that's what happened when I met..Stella."
17243,57,3,13,Ted is inside the doctor's office
17244,57,3,13,"Stella: Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang."
17245,57,3,13,"Ted: No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden..."
17246,57,3,13,"Stella: Well, I can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions, but, I should warn you, laser surgery's very painful."
17247,57,3,13,"Ted: Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made."
17248,57,3,13,"Stella: Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?"
17249,57,3,13,"Ted: No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate."
17250,57,3,13,"Stella: Uh, I'm a doctor, went to medical school. It's Plan 9. If you don't believe me, it's playing down at the Pamela Theater."
17251,57,3,13,"Ted: Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor."
17252,57,3,13,"Stella: Well, what are you doing tonight?"
17253,57,3,13,At the movie theater
17254,57,3,13,"(Ted arrives there, Stella is already there and is waiting to buy a ticket)"
17255,57,3,13,"Stella: Hey, Ted."
17256,57,3,13,"Ted: Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me."
17257,57,3,13,"Stella: Oh, no, no, don't..."
17258,57,3,13,"Ted: Come on, I insist."
17259,57,3,13,"Stella: That's so nice. Thank you. Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted. (3 women approaches) He wants to pay."
17260,57,3,13,"Ted: Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four."
17261,57,3,13,"(Later, the movie has begun, Stella's friends are sitting between she and Ted)"
17262,57,3,13,"Woman 1, to Ted: Is something wrong?"
17263,57,3,13,"Ted: No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it."
17264,57,3,13,"Woman 2, to Woman 1: What's wrong?"
17265,57,3,13,"Woman 1, to Woman 2: Ted's embarrassed-- he thought this was a date."
17266,57,3,13,"Woman 2, to Woman 3: Ted thought this was a date."
17267,57,3,13,"Woman 3, to Stella: Stella, did you know Ted thought this was a date?"
17268,57,3,13,"Stella, to Woman 3: What? I'm not allowed to date a patient. It's an AMA rule."
17269,57,3,13,"Woman 3, to Woman 2: She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule."
17270,57,3,13,"Woman 2, to Woman 1: She's not allowed to date patients. It's an AMA rule."
17271,57,3,13,"Woman 1, to Ted: She's not allowed to date..."
17272,57,3,13,"Ted: Yeah, I got it."
17273,57,3,13,Man: We all got it. Ted's a schmuck.
17274,57,3,13,[OPENING CREDITS]
17275,57,3,13,In Stella's office
17276,57,3,13,Stella: And you bought all the tickets.
17277,57,3,13,"Ted: Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie."
17278,57,3,13,Stella: I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.
17279,57,3,13,"Ted: No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then."
17280,57,3,13,"Stella: Well, then,fair warning: I'm going to say no."
17281,57,3,13,"Ted: Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?"
17282,57,3,13,Stella: No.
17283,57,3,13,Ted: Boyfriend?
17284,57,3,13,Stella: No.
17285,57,3,13,Ted: Lesbian?
17286,57,3,13,Stella: No.
17287,57,3,13,Ted: Only date black guys?
17288,57,3,13,Stella: No.
17289,57,3,13,"Ted: And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be..."
17290,57,3,13,Stella: No.
17291,57,3,13,At the Bar
17292,57,3,13,"Robin: No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic."
17293,57,3,13,Ted: This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?
17294,57,3,13,"Marshall: Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake."
17295,57,3,13,"Barney: Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind."
17296,57,3,13,Ted: That's ridiculous.
17297,57,3,13,Barney: Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.
17298,57,3,13,[FLASHBACK]
17299,57,3,13,Ted is waiting for his appointment.
17300,57,3,13,Stella: Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up.

17302,57,3,13,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17303,57,3,13,"Ted: So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'."
17304,57,3,13,"Robin: Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?"
17305,57,3,13,"Lily: I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails."
17306,57,3,13,"Marshall: But, baby, you love biting your nails."
17307,57,3,13,"Lily: I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard."
17308,57,3,13,"Ted: Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that ""no"" into a ""yes."""
17309,57,3,13,"Barney: Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?"
17310,57,3,13,[FLASHBACK]
17311,57,3,13,(Ted is lying on a table)
17312,57,3,13,Stella: This is going to hurt a little.
17313,57,3,13,"Ted: Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... (He screams in a high-pitched ton)"
17314,57,3,13,"Stella: Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts. Everyone probably sounds like that."
17315,57,3,13,"(Abby, the receptionist, enters the room)"
17316,57,3,13,"Abby: Doctor, are you all right? I heard a woman screaming in here. Oh. (she starts laughing and leave)"
17317,57,3,13,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17318,57,3,13,Ted: Here's to nine more great sessions.
17319,57,3,13,Ted from 2030: Weeks went by. The second session I told her about how I spent a summer working with inner-city kids. The third session we both spoke nothing but French. The fourth session I made her laugh so hard she fell out of her chair. So by the time the fifth session came around...
17320,57,3,13,Stella: Still no.
17321,57,3,13,At the Bar
17322,57,3,13,"Ted: Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled."
17323,57,3,13,Barney: You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.
17324,57,3,13,Ted: You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?
17325,57,3,13,Barney: Magic's not lame.
17326,57,3,13,Ted: I don't get it. I mean...
17327,57,3,13,Barney: Is this lame?
17328,57,3,13,"Robin: Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table."
17329,57,3,13,Marshall: What the hell is wrong with you?
17330,57,3,13,Robin: There's alcohol in here.
17331,57,3,13,Lily: Barney...
17332,57,3,13,Barney: I...
17333,57,3,13,Lily: We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.
17334,57,3,13,"Barney: Yeah, but Ted provoked me."
17335,57,3,13,"Lily: No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there."
17336,57,3,13,Barney: But...
17337,57,3,13,Lily: Go!
17338,57,3,13,Ted: Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.
17339,57,3,13,"Lily: You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face."
17340,57,3,13,"Marshall: Works for baboons. It's called ""presenting."""
17341,57,3,13,Ted: I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.
17342,57,3,13,"Barney: You can't turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" Ted. Can't be done."
17343,57,3,13,"Robin: I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said ""yes"" eventually."
17344,57,3,13,"Barney: No, you didn't. You were like, ""No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group."""
17345,57,3,13,Robin: To Ted.
17346,57,3,13,"Barney: Oh, right."
17347,57,3,13,"Ted: Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle."

17351,57,3,13,"Stella: Abby, I've told you before."
17352,57,3,13,Abby:...Please...
17353,57,3,13,"Stella: When they're rude to you, hang up the phone."
17354,57,3,13,Abby:...how difficult it is for me to...
17355,57,3,13,"Stella: Go on, you can do this, hang up. Abby, hang it up."
17356,57,3,13,Abby: I am too busy to waste my time... (Abby finally hangs up)
17357,57,3,13,"Stella: I'm sorry, I just wish that some of the patients would be nicer to you."

17359,57,3,13,Ted: The receptionist. That's my way in.
17360,57,3,13,Barney: I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.
17361,57,3,13,Ted: That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?
17362,57,3,13,Barney: Who?
17363,57,3,13,Ted: Here's the plan.

17367,57,3,13,"Abby: Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice. You're like a knight. I should call you Sir Ted."
17368,57,3,13,Ted: What?
17369,57,3,13,"Abby: Nothing. Nothing. (laughs nervously) It's really stupid. (She calls Stella, who is standing right behind her) Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here."
17370,57,3,13,"Stella: Thanks. Thanks, Abby."
17371,57,3,13,At the Bar
17372,57,3,13,Ted: And now... we wait.

17378,57,3,13,Ted: Abby is...?
17379,57,3,13,"Stella: My receptionist. You really made quite an impression on her with the coffee the other day. I mean, she has really not stopped talking about you."
17380,57,3,13,"Ted: Oh, Abby. I thought you said ""Alan."""
17381,57,3,13,"Stella: But you just said, ""Abby is...?"""
17382,57,3,13,"Ted: Right. Right, I thought I said ""Alan."""

17389,57,3,13,"Lily: Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks."

17394,57,3,13,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17395,57,3,13,"Ted: I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about."
17396,57,3,13,Marshall: It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory.
17397,57,3,13,Ted: Can I borrow your copy?
17398,57,3,13,Marshall: I left it somewhere... I forget.

17404,57,3,13,"Abby, laughing: That's funny. That's funny, smart, and great."
17405,57,3,13,"Stella: I am so sorry that I am late. I have, like, two minutes for lunch everyday."
17406,57,3,13,"Ted: It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny..."
17407,57,3,13,"Stella: What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here."
17408,57,3,13,"Ted: Oh, thank God. (chuckling) I couldn't agree more. That's total crap. I see people reading that on the subway and I just want to shout, ""Get a life, people!"""

17412,57,3,13,Abby: Your book 'The Power of Me'. I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage.
17413,57,3,13,"Ted: What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life."
17414,57,3,13,"Abby: No, you were reading it in the lobby."

17478,57,3,13,"Stella: You know, we should really get this mole checked out. It's just a little irregular."
17479,57,3,13,"Marshall: Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over."

17484,57,3,13,"Stella: Oh, that... that's nothing. It's just a little crush. So I will be calling you with your results."

17494,57,3,13,Ted from 2030: The moment I'd waited ten weeks for had arrived.

17502,57,3,13,Stella: I have a daughter.
17503,57,3,13,Ted: What?
17504,57,3,13,"Stella: Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call."

17508,57,3,13,Ted: I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.

17535,57,3,13,"Stella: Oh, already cut up. Nice."
17536,57,3,13,Ted: Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds.
17537,57,3,13,Waitress: Of course.
17538,57,3,13,"Ted: Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?"
17539,57,3,13,Stella: A little bit.
17540,57,3,13,Ted: You can't tell at all.
17541,57,3,13,"Stella: Oh, good. Yeah."
17542,57,3,13,Ranjit: Hello!
17543,57,3,13,Ted: 384 West 22nd.
17544,57,3,13,Stella: 15 seconds. The movie's started.
17545,57,3,13,"Ted: Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet."
17546,57,3,13,"Stella: So, what are we seeing?"
17547,57,3,13,Ted: Manos: Hands of Fate.
17548,57,3,13,Stella: The whole thing?
17549,57,3,13,Ted: Only the important parts. Worst movie ever.
17550,57,3,13,"Stella: Yeah, I almost walked out, like, five times."
17551,57,3,13,Ted: How we doing on time? Taxi!
17552,57,3,13,Stella: We got a little time.
17553,57,3,13,Ted: Okay. Do you want to walk it?
17554,57,3,13,Stella: Why not?
17555,57,3,13,Ranjit: Hello! Good-bye!
17556,57,3,13,Ted: So what grade's your daughter in?
17557,57,3,13,Stella: Third grade.
17558,57,3,13,Ted: Ah! That's a good year.
17559,57,3,13,"Stella: Yeah, she's wonderful. I just wish that I could get her to quit smoking, you know?"
17560,57,3,13,Ted: What?
17561,57,3,13,Stella: I'm kidding.
17562,57,3,13,"Ted: Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?"
17563,57,3,13,"Stella: You know, this neighborhood just keeps on changing. This used to be a cute, little Italian restaurant."
17564,57,3,13,"Ted: I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go."
17565,57,3,13,"Stella: Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing."
17566,57,3,13,Ted: Flowers?
17567,57,3,13,Stella: I'm allergic.
17568,57,3,13,"Ted: Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time."
17569,57,3,13,"Stella: Me, too, Ted."
17570,57,3,13,Ted: And... date.
17571,57,3,13,Stella: Huh?
17572,57,3,13,"Ted: That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss."
17573,57,3,13,Stella: I think I can be late just once. (They kiss) Ted...
17574,57,3,13,"Ted: Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?"
17575,57,3,13,Stella: Yes.
17576,57,3,13,Ted: Okay.
17577,57,3,13,"Ted from 2030: And that, kids, is how you turn a ""no"" into a ""yes."""
17578,57,3,13,"Abby: All my friends told me, ""Abby, be strong. He doesn't deserve another chance."" But I forgive you! (She runs after Ted)"
17579,57,3,13,"Ted: No, no, no, no!"
17580,57,3,13,At the center
17581,57,3,13,Abby:...then he just kept toying with my emotions.
17582,57,3,13,Barney: Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.
17583,57,3,13,Abby: Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?
17584,57,3,13,"Barney: Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?"
17585,57,3,13,Abby: My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.
17586,57,3,13,Barney: We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.
17587,57,3,13,"Abby: Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have s*x on it and then go shopping."
17588,57,3,13,Barney: I like you.
17589,58,3,14,"Ted from 2030: Kids,back when we were younger, your Uncle Marshall and I were really into college basketball. Every year,March Madness would take over the entire apartment."
17590,58,3,14,At Ted's apartment
17591,58,3,14,(Lily and Robin arrive)
17592,58,3,14,Robin: Hey.What's with the blackboard?
17593,58,3,14,Ted: It's our NCAA bracket.
17594,58,3,14,Marshall: Big board equals big luck!
17595,58,3,14,"Lily: Hey, that looks familiar, where did you get it?"
17596,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17597,58,3,14,Marshall comes into Lily's classroom with flowers. There's no one inside except for the cleaner.
17598,58,3,14,"Marshall: Hello. Uh, I'm looking for my wife, Ms.Aldrin."
17599,58,3,14,Cleaner: There's no school today. It's Saturday.
17600,58,3,14,Marshall: Of course. How could I forget?
17601,58,3,14,Cleaner: Dumb ass.
17602,58,3,14,(The cleaner leaves the classroom. Ted comes in. He and Marshall take the blackboard out.)
17603,58,3,14,Ted: Big board!
17604,58,3,14,Marshall: Big luck!
17605,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17606,58,3,14,"Marshall: We found it. No big deal. Anyway, every year, Ted and I go in together on this big money pool out in Staten Island."
17607,58,3,14,"Ted: Yeah. The winner gets $100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag."
17608,58,3,14,Marshall: And you get to keep the duffel bag.
17609,58,3,14,Lily: Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.
17610,58,3,14,"Ted: That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness."
17611,58,3,14,Barney: Your team lost 20 minutes ago.
17612,58,3,14,Ted: I didn't know they were playing today.
17613,58,3,14,"Lily: You okay, Barney?"
17614,58,3,14,Barney: Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.
17615,58,3,14,Robin: Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?
17616,58,3,14,Barney: There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.
17617,58,3,14,Robin: Of course there are.
17618,58,3,14,"Barney: Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch."
17619,58,3,14,Lily: You could not be more evil.
17620,58,3,14,"Barney: Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl..."
17621,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17622,58,3,14,"(Barney is at the hardware store, et is talking to a crying woman.)"
17623,58,3,14,"Barney: Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder."
17624,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17625,58,3,14,Barney: I was only gone for a second when...
17626,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17627,58,3,14,(Barney comes back with a sturdier ladder)
17628,58,3,14,Barney: See? Skid-proof.
17629,58,3,14,(The woman slaps him)
17630,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17631,58,3,14,Barney: The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.
17632,58,3,14,Marshall: Pet store?
17633,58,3,14,"Ted: Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney."
17634,58,3,14,"Barney: God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog."
17635,58,3,14,Ted: I'm really bored at work.
17636,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17637,58,3,14,"Barney: I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here."
17638,58,3,14,"Woman: Oh, I want to take her home right now."
17639,58,3,14,"Barney: Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?"
17640,58,3,14,"Woman, slapping him: Jerk!"
17641,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17642,58,3,14,"Barney: Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum."
17643,58,3,14,"Lily: Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
17644,58,3,14,Barney: Lily.
17645,58,3,14,Lily: You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.
17646,58,3,14,Barney: No. Marshall.
17647,58,3,14,Marshall: You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!
17648,58,3,14,Barney: Oh. No. Robin.
17649,58,3,14,"Robin: You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends."
17650,58,3,14,"Barney: Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl..."
17651,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17652,58,3,14,"Barney: At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left."
17653,58,3,14,Woman: I'm so sorry.
17654,58,3,14,(Barney touches her face)
17655,58,3,14,"Barney: My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art."
17656,58,3,14,(The woman slaps him and leaves)
17657,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17658,58,3,14,Barney: Why does this keep happening?
17659,58,3,14,Lily: Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.
17660,58,3,14,"Barney: Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here."
17661,58,3,14,Ted from 2030: But the next night got even weirder.
17662,58,3,14,At the Bar
17663,58,3,14,Barney: Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.
17664,58,3,14,Lily: You never gonna believe what just happened.
17665,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17666,58,3,14,(2 minutes earlier...)
17667,58,3,14,"Barney: Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?"
17668,58,3,14,Lily: Alan Alda?
17669,58,3,14,Barney: No.
17670,58,3,14,(Barney stands up and goes away; a woman approaches Lily.)
17671,58,3,14,"Mystery woman: Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life."
17672,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17673,58,3,14,"Barney: Oh, my God. Where is she?"
17674,58,3,14,Lily: She must have left. She...
17675,58,3,14,"Barney: Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?"
17676,58,3,14,"Lily: She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy."
17677,58,3,14,Barney: Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?
17678,58,3,14,Lily: Yes!
17679,58,3,14,"Barney: That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!"
17680,58,3,14,[OPENING CREDITS]
17681,58,3,14,"Barney: Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?"
17682,58,3,14,Lily: It's karma.
17683,58,3,14,"Barney: Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good."
17684,58,3,14,"Ted: Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?"
17685,58,3,14,"Barney: My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with."
17686,58,3,14,Marshall: I have one. It's called my marriage license.
17687,58,3,14,"Ted: Come on, let's see the list."
17688,58,3,14,"Barney: Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list."
17689,58,3,14,At Barney's
17690,58,3,14,"Barney: This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?"
17691,58,3,14,"Lily: I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face."
17692,58,3,14,Ted: How many of these girls know they're being photographed?
17693,58,3,14,"Barney: All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out."
17694,58,3,14,"Lily: Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you."
17695,58,3,14,"Robin: Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into."
17696,58,3,14,Barney: Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.
17697,58,3,14,"Lily: I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot."
17698,58,3,14,Barney: This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?
17699,58,3,14,At Ted's
17700,58,3,14,"Barney: The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur."
17701,58,3,14,"Lily: Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!"
17702,58,3,14,"(Barney takes out the beer, and the tournament begins)"
17703,58,3,14,Lily: The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.
17704,58,3,14,"Robin: It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!"
17705,58,3,14,Ted: It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!
17706,58,3,14,"Robin: Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!"
17707,58,3,14,"Barney: Okay, okay, everybody! Hands."
17708,58,3,14,"Marshal, Lily and Ted: 12 hours to live!"
17709,58,3,14,Robin: Damn it!
17710,58,3,14,"Barney: Okay, toss up. ""Thought I was Jorge Posada,"" or ""You have my dead wife's kidney?"""
17711,58,3,14,Ted: Kidney!
17712,58,3,14,Robin: Jorge Posada!
17713,58,3,14,Lily: She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!
17714,58,3,14,Barney: That's true...
17715,58,3,14,"Marshall: It's ""Dead wife's kidney."" How are we even discussing this?"
17716,58,3,14,Lily: Fake baby!
17717,58,3,14,Marshall: Lost at sea!
17718,58,3,14,Ted: Fake baby!
17719,58,3,14,Marshall: Lost at sea!
17720,58,3,14,Ted: I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.
17721,58,3,14,"Barney: Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, ""Girl who thought I owned Google,"" up against the number seven seed, ""Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor."""
17722,58,3,14,Ted: You got to go scuba instructor.
17723,58,3,14,Robin: You're kidding me!
17724,58,3,14,Ted: She got the bends!
17725,58,3,14,"Barney: Yeah, she did."
17726,58,3,14,Marshall: Evil twin!
17727,58,3,14,Ted: Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
17728,58,3,14,"Robin: Barney, you're the tiebreaker."
17729,58,3,14,Barney: I'm going with Evil Twin.
17730,58,3,14,Ted: You're kidding me!
17731,58,3,14,"Barney: Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep."
17732,58,3,14,Robin: Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.
17733,58,3,14,Lily: Is that the blackboard from my classroom?
17734,58,3,14,Barney: Come on! Marshall?
17735,58,3,14,Marshall: I'm tired and sad.
17736,58,3,14,Barney: Mosby?
17737,58,3,14,"Ted: I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her."
17738,58,3,14,"Barney: Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar."
17739,58,3,14,Lily: You guys stole my blackboard!
17740,58,3,14,
17741,58,3,14,In the street
17742,58,3,14,"Barney: Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell."
17743,58,3,14,Lily: No.
17744,58,3,14,"Barney: What do you mean ""no""?"
17745,58,3,14,"Lily: That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, ""I'm sorry."""
17746,58,3,14,"Barney: Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car."
17747,58,3,14,"Lily: Barney, you're doing this."
17748,58,3,14,"Barney: Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!"
17749,58,3,14,"Lily: Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?"
17750,58,3,14,"Barney: If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River."
17751,58,3,14,Meg: What are you doing here?
17752,58,3,14,"Barney: Look, Meg, we need to talk."
17753,58,3,14,"Meg: It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong."
17754,58,3,14,Barney: And I forgive you. I love you.
17755,58,3,14,"Meg: Oh, my God! I love you, too!"
17756,58,3,14,(They kiss)
17757,58,3,14,"Lily: No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol..."
17758,58,3,14,(Barney leaves without a word)
17759,58,3,14,Inside a restaurant
17760,58,3,14,"Barney: So you remember who this one is, right?"
17761,58,3,14,Lily: Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.
17762,58,3,14,"Barney: Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I..."
17763,58,3,14,"Lily: Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize."
17764,58,3,14,"Barney: Ah, there she is."
17765,58,3,14,Lily: Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.
17766,58,3,14,"Barney: You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"
17767,58,3,14,Lily: I'm making a scrapbook.
17768,58,3,14,"(She takes a picture of him, as he is approaching Anna)"
17769,58,3,14,"Barney: Anna, hi."
17770,58,3,14,"Anna: Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it."
17771,58,3,14,Barney: What Web site?
17772,58,3,14,Anna: Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
17773,58,3,14,"Barney: You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com."
17774,58,3,14,"Ted from 2030: And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!"
17775,58,3,14,Lily and Barney are now knocking on Kate's door

17779,58,3,14,Kate: Larney! Die!
17780,58,3,14,Barney: Is it her?
17781,58,3,14,Kate: Die!
17782,58,3,14,Lily: Smile.
17783,58,3,14,Barney: You look good. Have you lost weight?
17784,58,3,14,They finally arrives at Holly's
17785,58,3,14,"Barney: We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly."
17786,58,3,14,[FLASHBACK]
17787,58,3,14,"Holly: Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!"
17788,58,3,14,[END OF FLASHBACK]
17789,58,3,14,Lily: That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.
17790,58,3,14,"Barney: But in my defense, she was kind of annoying."
17791,58,3,14,Lily: She's gonna kill you.
17792,58,3,14,(Holly opens the door)
17793,58,3,14,Holly: Barney.
17794,58,3,14,Barney: Holly.
17795,58,3,14,"Holly: Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fiancé. Mark."
17796,58,3,14,Mark: Barney? You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?
17797,58,3,14,Lily: So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?
17798,58,3,14,"Holly: No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future."
17799,58,3,14,"Mark: And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers."
17800,58,3,14,"Barney: Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes."
17801,58,3,14,Mark: Fourth of July? We started dating in June.
17802,58,3,14,Back at the apartment
17803,58,3,14,Lily: We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.
17804,58,3,14,"Barney: No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is."
17805,58,3,14,"Robin: Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up."
17806,58,3,14,Barney: That's not a bad idea.
17807,58,3,14,Robin: I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.
17808,58,3,14,Ted: I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.
17809,58,3,14,Robin: I do not.
17810,58,3,14,Ted: Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?
17811,58,3,14,"Robin: No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is."
17812,58,3,14,Barney: I'm in.
17813,58,3,14,"Robin: Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily..."
17814,58,3,14,(Robin starts imagining how it will go)
17815,58,3,14,"Robin:...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation."
17816,58,3,14,"Barney: Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!"
17817,58,3,14,"Robin: And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell."
17818,58,3,14,"Man: Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful."
17819,58,3,14,"Robin: I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move."
17820,58,3,14,"Barney: Hey, there, how are you doing?"
17821,58,3,14,"Robin: Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger."
17822,58,3,14,"Barney: Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?"
17823,58,3,14,"Robin: Get your hand off my thigh, Barney."
17824,58,3,14,"Barney: It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin."
17825,58,3,14,Robin: You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?
17826,58,3,14,"Barney: Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?"
17827,58,3,14,"Robin: No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom."
17828,58,3,14,"Barney: Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x."
17829,58,3,14,(Barney goes to the bathroom)
17830,58,3,14,"Ted: Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go."
17831,58,3,14,Marshall: I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? (Barney joins them at the booth) Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?
17832,58,3,14,Barney: I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.
17833,58,3,14,Marshall: Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.
17834,58,3,14,Ted: Are you okay?
17835,58,3,14,"Barney: I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize."
17836,58,3,14,"Lily: Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry."
17837,58,3,14,Barney: What? What?
17838,58,3,14,"Robin: Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other."
17839,58,3,14,Barney: So I apologized for nothing?
17840,58,3,14,"Lily: Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo ""Barney's Redemption."" Could you stop giving me the finger?"
17841,58,3,14,"Ted from 2030: Eventually, Barney did figure out who the mysterious girl was. But we on that later."

17845,59,3,15,"Ted from 2030: Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me. Stella and I had started dating, and I'd just gotten a big raise at work. So I decided to purchase something I knew would be the envy of all my friends."
17846,59,3,15,Outside
17847,59,3,15,Ted: A new car!
17848,59,3,15,"Barney: Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!"
17849,59,3,15,Robin: You can't call shotgun for eternity.
17850,59,3,15,Barney: I just called it.
17851,59,3,15,"Robin: You can't just call things, barney."

17915,59,3,15,"Barney: I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business."

17919,59,3,15,Ted: All of what?
17920,59,3,15,"Marshall: All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even Artillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!"

18010,59,3,15,"Marshall: You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?"

18016,59,3,15,"Lily: Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom."
18017,59,3,15,"Ted: Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?"
18018,59,3,15,(Ted picks up his phone)
18019,59,3,15,"Marshall: Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey."

18030,59,3,15,Downstairs...
18031,59,3,15,"Marshall: I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man."
18032,59,3,15,"Ted: Um... it's a new car, so just be careful..."
18033,59,3,15,"Marshall: I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive."
18034,59,3,15,"Ted: It's just, this is a really good parking spot."
18035,59,3,15,Marshall: Dude!
18036,59,3,15,"Ted: Look, just tell me what happened first."
18037,59,3,15,"Marshall: Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way."
18038,59,3,15,"Ted: There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?"

18051,59,3,15,"Marshall: No, I didn't want meatloaf."
18052,59,3,15,"Barney: Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else."

18054,59,3,15,"Barney: Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive."
18055,59,3,15,Marshall: Who would I even scream at?
18056,59,3,15,Barney: I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.

18067,59,3,15,"Marshall: I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney."
18068,59,3,15,"Barney: Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries."
18069,59,3,15,"Waiter: One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends."

18109,59,3,15,Marshall: I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!

You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be..."

18132,59,3,15,Marshall: What?

18249,60,3,16,Robin: I know. I'm sorry.
18250,60,3,16,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18251,60,3,16,"Robin: I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream."
18252,60,3,16,Barney: Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.
18253,60,3,16,[FLASHBACK]
18254,60,3,16,"Barney: So, Simon, how did you guys meet?"
18255,60,3,16,"Simon: Oh, I was in her video."
18256,60,3,16,Robin: Starred in it is more like it.
18257,60,3,16,"Simon: Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker."
18258,60,3,16,"Barney: I'm sorry. I've seen ""Let's Go to the Mall"" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it."
18259,60,3,16,"Simon: No, I was in the other one."
18260,60,3,16,Barney: There's another video?!
18261,60,3,16,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18262,60,3,16,"Barney: Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape."
18263,60,3,16,Robin: No.
18264,60,3,16,"Barney: All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found."
18265,60,3,16,Robin: Okay.
18266,60,3,16,"Marshall: It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool."
18267,60,3,16,"Robin: I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again."
18268,60,3,16,"Ted: Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though."
18269,60,3,16,"Marshall: It's called ""revertigo."""
18270,60,3,16,"Ted: Yeah, I don't know about ""revertigo."""
18271,60,3,16,"Marshall: You know who gets really bad revertigo? (whispers) Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle."
18272,60,3,16,Barney: Michelle? She sounds hot.
18273,60,3,16,Ted: You don't know about Lily and Michelle?
18274,60,3,16,Barney: No. What about Lily and Michelle?
18275,60,3,16,"Marshall: Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?"
18276,60,3,16,Lily: What?
18277,60,3,16,"Marshall: You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while."
18278,60,3,16,"Lily: Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out."
18279,60,3,16,Barney: What... (stammers) Do they make out?
18280,60,3,16,Marshall: Better.
18281,60,3,16,Ted: Comparable.
18282,60,3,16,Marshall: Comparable.
18283,60,3,16,"Robin: Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance."
18284,60,3,16,
18285,60,3,16,"Later, at the Bar"
18286,60,3,16,Robin: I got a second chance.
18287,60,3,16,Lily: What happened?
18288,60,3,16,Robin: He came by my place tonight...
18289,60,3,16,[FLASHBACK]
18290,60,3,16,Robin: Simon. What are you doing here?
18291,60,3,16,Simon: I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.
18292,60,3,16,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18293,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, I like where this is going."
18294,60,3,16,[FLASHBACK]
18295,60,3,16,"Simon: I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?"
18296,60,3,16,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18297,60,3,16,"Lily: He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon."
18298,60,3,16,Ted: The coup de grace.
18299,60,3,16,Barney: Finish him!
18300,60,3,16,[FLASHBACK]
18301,60,3,16,Robin: I'd love to!
18302,60,3,16,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18303,60,3,16,Ted: Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?
18304,60,3,16,"Lily: Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you."
18305,60,3,16,"Robin: That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?"
18306,60,3,16,"Lily: Oh, hell, no!"
18307,60,3,16,Marshall: I think you're gonna enjoy this.
18308,60,3,16,Lily: That my girl Michelle?
18309,60,3,16,"Michelle: Bitch, you know it!"
18310,60,3,16,Lily: How she livin'?
18311,60,3,16,Michelle: She living only way she know how to. Large!
18312,60,3,16,"Lily: Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here."
18313,60,3,16,Michelle: I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.
18314,60,3,16,Lily: For reals.
18315,60,3,16,(Lily and Michelle leave the bar together)
18316,60,3,16,"Barney: I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle."
18317,60,3,16,In some garage
18318,60,3,16,(Robin is watching Simon's band playing)
18319,60,3,16,Robin: Yeah!
18320,60,3,16,"Simon: Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?"
18321,60,3,16,Robin: That rocked.
18322,60,3,16,"Simon: Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back."
18323,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, uh, sure."
18324,60,3,16,"Simon: Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later."
18325,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning."
18326,60,3,16,"Simon: Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show."
18327,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news."
18328,60,3,16,"Simon: Right. So you can be, like ""Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out."" And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs."
18329,60,3,16,Robin is presenting the news...
18330,60,3,16,"Robin: And now it's time for ""Puppy Corner,"" some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter."
18331,60,3,16,Dog's pictures are shown with Simon's music in the background (hard-metal music)
18332,60,3,16,At the Bar
18333,60,3,16,"Robin: Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to kill them."
18334,60,3,16,"Marshall: Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work."
18335,60,3,16,Lily: What's revertigo?
18336,60,3,16,"Ted: It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning."
18337,60,3,16,"Marshall: No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them."
18338,60,3,16,Lily: Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.
18339,60,3,16,Marshall: You do?
18340,60,3,16,Lily: Yeah. Ted.
18341,60,3,16,Ted: Me?
18342,60,3,16,"Lily: Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again."
18343,60,3,16,"Ted: Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that."
18344,60,3,16,[FLASHBACK]
18345,60,3,16,(Someone is knocking at the door)
18346,60,3,16,"Ted: Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?"
18347,60,3,16,"Punchy: 'Sup, Shmosby?!"
18348,60,3,16,Ted: You want to go?
18349,60,3,16,Punchy: I'm already there!
18350,60,3,16,"Ted: Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad."
18351,60,3,16,"Punchy:Yeah, it was a real shock."
18352,60,3,16,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18353,60,3,16,"Ted: I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this."
18354,60,3,16,Lily: Why?
18355,60,3,16,Ted: No reason.
18356,60,3,16,"Marshall: Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?"
18357,60,3,16,"Robin: Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together."
18358,60,3,16,"Lily: Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you."
18359,60,3,16,"Robin: You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?"
18360,60,3,16,Lily: I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?
18361,60,3,16,Robin: That's exactly what my mom would say.
18362,60,3,16,"Lily: No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, ""We forbid you from seeing this boy."""
18363,60,3,16,Robin: Lily!
18364,60,3,16,"Lily: No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good."
18365,60,3,16,Robin: This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!
18366,60,3,16,"Marshall: Now, now. We were once young and in love, too."
18367,60,3,16,"Robin: Yeah, like, a billion years ago."
18368,60,3,16,"Lily: You've been drinking, haven't you?"
18369,60,3,16,"Robin: Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round."
18370,60,3,16,Lily: You're not going to that show tonight!
18371,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way."
18372,60,3,16,"Lily: Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help."
18373,60,3,16,"Ted: Hey, so, today at work..."
18374,60,3,16,"Marshall: Not now, Ted!"
18375,60,3,16,Ted: Geez.
18376,60,3,16,At the back of Simon's van
18377,60,3,16,(Robin is lifting boxes into the van)
18378,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock."
18379,60,3,16,Simon: Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!
18380,60,3,16,"Robin: God, I just love seeing you so happy."
18381,60,3,16,"Simon: Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over."
18382,60,3,16,Robin: What?
18383,60,3,16,Simon: I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.
18384,60,3,16,"Robin, laughing: What? You're kidding me. You're breaking up with me? Again? F-For the same ex-girlfriend? In the same van? What is it? Her-Her parents got a pool? Is that still the reason?"
18385,60,3,16,At the Bar
18386,60,3,16,"Ted: Well... I'm sorry, Robin."
18387,60,3,16,"Robin: I'm fine, really."
18388,60,3,16,"Lily: Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?"
18389,60,3,16,"Michelle: Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub."
18390,60,3,16,Lily: Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.
18391,60,3,16,"Ted: So, how's Columbia?"
18392,60,3,16,Michelle: Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.
18393,60,3,16,"Robin: Um, can I make an observation?"
18394,60,3,16,"Michelle: Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon."
18395,60,3,16,Marshall: Revertigo?
18396,60,3,16,"Michelle:No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!"
18397,60,3,16,(Lily and Michelle start dancing around)
18398,60,3,16,"Ted from 2030: One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin."
18399,60,3,16,Barney: All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?
18400,60,3,16,Robin: Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.
18401,60,3,16,"Barney: Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago."
18402,60,3,16,"Robin: No, tonight."
18403,60,3,16,"Barney: Ooh. Really? (Robin starts crying)Oh! Oh, come here."
18404,60,3,16,"Robin: It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again."
18405,60,3,16,"Barney: Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome."
18406,60,3,16,"Robin: Right. Of course, the-the first being you."
18407,60,3,16,Barney: No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.
18408,60,3,16,"Robin: Barney, do you want to come back to my place?"
18409,60,3,16,Barney: Your place?
18410,60,3,16,At Robin's
18411,60,3,16,Barney: Are you sure you want to do this?
18412,60,3,16,"Robin: Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?"
18413,60,3,16,"Barney: Of course. So, should I just put it in?"
18414,60,3,16,"Robin: Yeah, why not?"
18415,60,3,16,(Barney plays a video tape)
18416,60,3,16,"Robin: This was my big artistic follow-up to""Let's Go to the Mall."" It kind of tanked."
18417,60,3,16,Barney: Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.
18418,60,3,16,"Robin: Oh, I'm so glad."
18419,60,3,16,Barney: Is that Alan Thicke?
18420,60,3,16,Robin: Yeah.
18421,60,3,16,"Barney: You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?"
18422,60,3,16,"Robin: Yeah, you're right. I was lame."
18423,60,3,16,"Barney: Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad."
18424,60,3,16,Robin: He was my sidekick. He had to be.
18425,60,3,16,Ted from 2030: And so they watched it again... And again... And again. They watched it over and over that night until finally... (Robin and Barney kiss) they stopped watching.
18426,61,3,17,"Ted from 2030: Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed."
18427,61,3,17,In Robin's bedroom
18428,61,3,17,"Barney: In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat."
18429,61,3,17,Robin: Check.
18430,61,3,17,"Barney: Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again."
18431,61,3,17,"Robin: And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, ""who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?"""
18432,61,3,17,"Barney: Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend"
18433,61,3,17,Robin: And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.
18434,61,3,17,Barney: Best friend.
18435,61,3,17,"Robin: Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened."
18436,61,3,17,"Barney: Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan."
18437,61,3,17,Robin: Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.
18438,61,3,17,"Barney: Okay. Right. So, Robin?"
18439,61,3,17,"Robin: Yes, Barney?"
18440,61,3,17,Barney: Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?
18441,61,3,17,[OPENING CREDITS]
18442,61,3,17,"Robin: I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out."
18443,61,3,17,Barney: Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.
18444,61,3,17,Ted from 2030: But pretending it never happened wouldn't be that easy.
18445,61,3,17,At the Bar
18446,61,3,17,"Ted: So, tell us, what was it like?"
18447,61,3,17,Barney: What?
18448,61,3,17,"Ted: Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table."
18449,61,3,17,Barney: I... I... I'm... I'm...
18450,61,3,17,"Marshall: Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon."
18451,61,3,17,"Robin: Yeah, you are."
18452,61,3,17,"Marshall: Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts."
18453,61,3,17,"Lily: It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there."
18454,61,3,17,Barney: What are you talking about?!
18455,61,3,17,"Ted: The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?"
18456,61,3,17,"Barney: Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, ""try again."" How you doing there, Robin?"
18457,61,3,17,Robin: I'm good.
18458,61,3,17,"Ted: Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?"
18459,61,3,17,"Barney: Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?"
18460,61,3,17,Ted: Liking video games?
18461,61,3,17,Robin: I'm gonna get a drink.
18462,61,3,17,Barney: I'll come with you.
18463,61,3,17,Robin: Okay.
18464,61,3,17,"Barney: God, this is awkward."
18465,61,3,17,Robin: What is?
18466,61,3,17,Barney: Being around Ted.
18467,61,3,17,Robin: Why?
18468,61,3,17,Barney: Because of our thing.
18469,61,3,17,Robin: What thing?
18470,61,3,17,Barney: You're really gonna pretend this never happened?
18471,61,3,17,(Ted arrives behind Barney and startles him)
18472,61,3,17,Ted: What never happened? What are you guys talking about?
18473,61,3,17,Robin: Nothing.
18474,61,3,17,"Ted: Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella."
18475,61,3,17,"Barney: Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro."
18476,61,3,17,At Marshall's
18477,61,3,17,"(Marshall is playing a video game. His phone starts ringing, he picks up)"
18478,61,3,17,Marshall: Hello.
18479,61,3,17,"Barney: Hey, Marshall, I need your help."
18480,61,3,17,"Marshall: Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now."
18481,61,3,17,Barney: I know. I want to hire you.
18482,61,3,17,"Marshall: For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler."
18483,61,3,17,Barney: I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.
18484,61,3,17,Marshall: How much?
18485,61,3,17,Barney: A little.
18486,61,3,17,Marshall: I'll take it.
18487,61,3,17,In Barney's office
18488,61,3,17,"Marshall: Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal."

18491,61,3,17,"Barney: Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily."
18492,61,3,17,"Marshall: No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I..."
18493,61,3,17,"Barney: You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... (Marshall covers his ears with his hands and starts singing) Stop..stop doing that. (Barney throws a bowling ball at him, Marshall catches it) I slept... I slept with Robin."
18494,61,3,17,Marshall: You slept with Robin?
18495,61,3,17,Barney: Are you mad at me?
18496,61,3,17,Marshall: I don't know.
18497,61,3,17,Barney: How's the hot dog?
18498,61,3,17,"Marshall: It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily."
18499,61,3,17,Barney: You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.
18500,61,3,17,Marshall: Why are you doing this to me?!
18501,61,3,17,"Barney: Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong."
18502,61,3,17,"Marshall: How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?"
18503,61,3,17,"Barney: I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code."

18518,61,3,17,George: So what if I did? There's no rule against it.
18519,61,3,17,"Benjamin: Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros."
18520,61,3,17,"George: But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill."

18530,61,3,17,"Marshall: Yeah, because you slept with Robin."
18531,61,3,17,"Barney: No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states ""No s*x with your bro's ex."" But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye."
18532,61,3,17,Marshall: And you would pay me for that?
18533,61,3,17,"Barney: No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang."
18534,61,3,17,"Marshall: Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?"

18543,61,3,17,Ted from 2030: And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from... So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.

18940,63,3,19,"Barney: Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid ""meaningful relationship"" with Stella."
18941,63,3,19,Abby: I hate Ted.
18942,63,3,19,Barney: I hate Ted more.
18943,63,3,19,Abby: Are you as turned on as I am?
18944,63,3,19,Barney: Probably not quite as much.
18945,63,3,19,"(Later, they are both in bed...)"
18946,63,3,19,"Abby: I'm sorry I yelled out ""Ted."""
18947,63,3,19,"Barney: I'm sorry I yelled out ""Abby."""
18948,63,3,19,Abby: I am Abby.
18949,63,3,19,"Barney: Oh, cool."
18950,63,3,19,At the apartment
18951,63,3,19,Ted: This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?
18952,63,3,19,"Robin: Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?"
18953,63,3,19,"Ted: As a matter of fact, no, there isn't."
18954,63,3,19,"Robin: Whatever, red cowboy boots."
18955,63,3,19,Ted: Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.
18956,63,3,19,"Marshall: Hey, Lil, if I were to say ""Ted could never pull them off,"" What would I be talking about?"
18957,63,3,19,Robin: His red cowboy boots.
18958,63,3,19,Ted: I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.
18959,63,3,19,"Marshall: Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin."
18960,63,3,19,"Robin: ""The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous."""
18961,63,3,19,"Lily: ""The Magnificent Kevin."""
18962,63,3,19,"Marshall: ""No Country for Straight Men."""
18963,63,3,19,Lily: I don't want to sell my clothes!
18964,63,3,19,"Robin: Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?"
18965,63,3,19,"Marshall: Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do."
18966,63,3,19,Lily: I'll sell my paintings!
18967,63,3,19,Marshall: What?
18968,63,3,19,"Lily: Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500."
18969,63,3,19,Marshall: Yeah. Totally. But...
18970,63,3,19,"Ted from 2030: Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row..."
18971,63,3,19,[FLASHBACK]
18972,63,3,19,Lily shows her paintings to Marshall)
18973,63,3,19,Marshall: I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!
18974,63,3,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
18975,63,3,19,"Ted from 2030: But then, that thousand-and-first time..."
18976,63,3,19,Marshall:...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.
18977,63,3,19,Lily: What does that mean?
18978,63,3,19,"Marshall: Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it."
18979,63,3,19,Lily: You don't believe in me.
18980,63,3,19,"Marshall: No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!"
18981,63,3,19,"Lily: Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?"
18982,63,3,19,"Marshall: I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic."
18983,63,3,19,"Lily: Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?"
18984,63,3,19,"Marshall: About 1,500 bucks."
18985,63,3,19,"Lily: Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes."
18986,63,3,19,"Marshall: Babe, we need money fast."
18987,63,3,19,"Lily: Well, give me a week."
18988,63,3,19,"Marshall: Okay, a-a week."
18989,63,3,19,Lily: Fine.
18990,63,3,19,Marshall: Fine.
18991,63,3,19,"(Ted comes out of his room, with the red boots on.)"
18992,63,3,19,Ted: Pulling... Them... Off.
18993,63,3,19,Ted from 2030: Lily's first move on a great art challenge of 2008 was to display one of her favorite paintings at her friend's gallery. The night didn't go so well. But then at the last minute...
18994,63,3,19,Woman: I love it.
18995,63,3,19,Lily: You do?
18996,63,3,19,"Woman: Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?"
18997,63,3,19,Lily: It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!
18998,63,3,19,"Ted from 2030: So the next day, Lily took her painting to a coffee house that displayed local artists."
18999,63,3,19,Lily: We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.
19000,63,3,19,Robin: Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?
19001,63,3,19,"Ted: Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance."
19002,63,3,19,"Robin: Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche."
19003,63,3,19,"Ted: Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors ""neat"" or are they more ""neato burrito?"""
19004,63,3,19,"Robin: Uh, then again, red cowboy boots."
19005,63,3,19,Ted: I pull these off! (Everyone is laughing at him) I pull these off!
19006,63,3,19,In bed...
19007,63,3,19,Abby: You know what I hate most about Ted?
19008,63,3,19,Barney: What?
19009,63,3,19,"Abby: His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome."
19010,63,3,19,Barney: You know what I hate most about Ted?
19011,63,3,19,Abby: What?
19012,63,3,19,"Barney: How he's always like, ""Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with."" He's so lame."
19013,63,3,19,Abby: He's so lame and awesome.
19014,63,3,19,Barney: You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.
19015,63,3,19,"Abby: Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
19016,63,3,19,Barney: I think so.
19017,63,3,19,Abby: You're thinking of having s*x with Ted?
19018,63,3,19,"Ted from 2030: After four days without selling a single painting, Lily was getting desperate."
19019,63,3,19,In the street
19020,63,3,19,Lily: Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.
19021,63,3,19,"Man: Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?"
19022,63,3,19,"Lily: Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?"
19023,63,3,19,Man: Heroin.
19024,63,3,19,Lily: Do you like heroin?
19025,63,3,19,"Man: Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin."
19026,63,3,19,"Lily: Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this..."
19027,63,3,19,Man: It's not very good.
19028,63,3,19,"Ted from 2030: And just as she was about to lose all hope, something amazing happened."
19029,63,3,19,"Man: 2 Oh, my God!"
19030,63,3,19,At the Bar
19031,63,3,19,(Lily arrives)
19032,63,3,19,"Lily: 500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?"
19033,63,3,19,"Marshall: Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter."
19034,63,3,19,"Lily: Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... ""Suck It!"""
19035,63,3,19,"Marshall: Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?"
19036,63,3,19,"Lily: Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!"
19037,63,3,19,Ted: You bagged a G-CWOK?!
19038,63,3,19,"Lily: Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community."
19039,63,3,19,Ted: You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.
19040,63,3,19,"Lily: That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it."
19041,63,3,19,
19042,63,3,19,(Barney and Abby arrives as Lily is leaving)
19043,63,3,19,"Barney: Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?"
19044,63,3,19,"Ted: Uh, yeah."
19045,63,3,19,"Barney: Hi, Abby."
19046,63,3,19,"Ted: Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?"
19047,63,3,19,"Barney: That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?"
19048,63,3,19,"Abby: That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted."
19049,63,3,19,"Barney: Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor."
19050,63,3,19,Abby: We're showing Ted how lame he is.
19051,63,3,19,"Barney: You don't have to say it, though."
19052,63,3,19,"Ted: Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop."
19053,63,3,19,"Barney: Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing."
19054,63,3,19,"Abby: We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing."
19055,63,3,19,"Ted: Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop."
19056,63,3,19,"Barney: Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?"
19057,63,3,19,"Abby: Wait, really?"
19058,63,3,19,Barney: I would never joke about true love.
19059,63,3,19,"Abby: Yes, I'll marry you."
19060,63,3,19,Barney: Okay.
19061,63,3,19,"Abby: Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom."
19062,63,3,19,Barney: That's you.
19063,63,3,19,"Ted: Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding."
19064,63,3,19,"Barney: Uh, yes, she does."
19065,63,3,19,"Abby: It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle."
19066,63,3,19,Barney: Totally committed to the bit.
19067,63,3,19,Lily's on the phone
19068,63,3,19,"Lily: Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today."
19069,63,3,19,"Man 2: Oh, honey, hello."
19070,63,3,19,Lily: You sound happy.
19071,63,3,19,Man 2: Are you kidding? We're popping the champagne right now.
19072,63,3,19,"Lily: Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings."
19073,63,3,19,"Man 2: Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh, I guess I should have told you. We just bought that for the frame."
19074,63,3,19,Lily: What?
19075,63,3,19,"Man 2: Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer, a very rare frame from the turn of the century."
19076,63,3,19,Lily: So... y-you didn't like my painting?
19077,63,3,19,"Man 2: Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all. But you know, good for you."
19078,63,3,19,"Lily: Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?"
19079,63,3,19,"Man 2: Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore."
19080,63,3,19,Lily: Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.
19081,63,3,19,"Man 2: Champagne for everyone on me, the happiest guy in the world."
19082,63,3,19,At the apartment
19083,63,3,19,"Lily: This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me."
19084,63,3,19,Robin: Really?
19085,63,3,19,Lily: Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.
19086,63,3,19,[FLSHBACK]
19087,63,3,19,"Lily is walking up the street, a man looks at her."
19088,63,3,19,Man: Da-amn.
19089,63,3,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
19090,63,3,19,"Lily: I got a two-syllable ""damn"" in this dress."
19091,63,3,19,"Robin: A two-syllable ""damn."" That's the dream."
19092,63,3,19,Lily: Yeah. Now she belongs to...  e CanadaGirl@MetroNewsOne.com e .
19093,63,3,19,Robin: It's still in the family.
19094,63,3,19,(Marshall and Ted arrive)
19095,63,3,19,"Marshall: Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened."
19096,63,3,19,Lily: What?
19097,63,3,19,Marshall: I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.
19098,63,3,19,Lily: Really? Why?
19099,63,3,19,Marshall: Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.
19100,63,3,19,Robin: It's still in the family.
19101,63,3,19,"Marshall: And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace."
19102,63,3,19,"Lily: Well, what happened?"
19103,63,3,19,[FLASHBACK]
19104,63,3,19,Marshall and Ted arrive at the G-CWOK's apartment.
19105,63,3,19,"Man 2: Well, hello."
19106,63,3,19,"Marshall: Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame."
19107,63,3,19,"Lawrence: Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out."
19108,63,3,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
19109,63,3,19,"Lily: Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you."
19110,63,3,19,"Marshall: No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part."
19111,63,3,19,Ted: Here's the important part.
19112,63,3,19,[FLASHBACK]
19113,63,3,19,"Ted: Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots?"
19114,63,3,19,Lawrence: Walter. Boots.
19115,63,3,19,Walter: Pulling... Them.... Off.
19116,63,3,19,Ted: I'll be in the cab.
19117,63,3,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
19118,63,3,19,Ted: G-CWOK-approved.
19119,63,3,19,Lily: The painting!
19120,63,3,19,"Marshall: Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster."
19121,63,3,19,[FLASHBACK]
19122,63,3,19,"Marshall: It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash."
19123,63,3,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
19124,63,3,19,Lily: Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?
19125,63,3,19,Marshall: You're about to find out.
19126,63,3,19,At the vet
19127,63,3,19,Dr Greer: I had to make a trash run. Been a busy day-- lots of neuterings.
19128,63,3,19,"Lily: Ooh, we don't need the details."
19129,63,3,19,"Dr Greer: Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think. Oh, thank God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles."
19130,63,3,19,[FLASHBACK]
19131,63,3,19,"Dr Greer: Anyway... I noticed your painting just sitting right there on top and I thought, ""Hey,free painting,"" so I brought it upstairs and hung it up in Exam Room 3, and then the strangest thing happened. Hey, Muffin. Whoa, I think he remembers me from the last time he was here. Take Muffin to Exam Room 3. I'll meet you there. I went in, expecting the worst. I'd never seen Muffin that calm, and then a little later the same thing happened again with Tidbit... and King Larry... and again with the Weinstein triplets."
19132,63,3,19,[END OF FLASHBACK]
19133,63,3,19,Dr Greer: Something about your art speaks to the canine sensibility on a very primal level.
19134,63,3,19,Lily: Really? Dogs like my paintings?
19135,63,3,19,"Dr Greer: Yeah. But you know who it bums out? Birds. Yeah. Had a parrot in there today. He took one look at it, pried open his cage, flew right into the ceiling fan."
19136,63,3,19,"Marshall: Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more."
19137,63,3,19,Lily: Really?
19138,63,3,19,"Marshall: Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece."
19139,63,3,19,Lily: That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.
19140,63,3,19,"Marshall: Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it."
19141,63,3,19,Lily: In what?
19142,63,3,19,Marshall: In you.
19143,63,3,19,At the apartment
19144,63,3,19,Ted from 2030: Marshall explained that he was building a fancy new Web site specifically to sell Lily's artwork to veterinarians.
19145,63,3,19,"Lily: Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me."
19146,63,3,19,(They kiss; a bird crashes into their window)
19147,63,3,19,"Marshall: Man, birds do not get you."
19148,63,3,19,At Abby's
19149,63,3,19,"Abby: Hi, sweetie."
19150,63,3,19,"Barney: Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?"
19151,63,3,19,"Abby: No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?"
19152,63,3,19,"Barney: Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit."
19153,63,3,19,"Abby: So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America."
19154,63,3,19,"Barney: Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you."
19155,63,3,19,Abby: What?
19156,63,3,19,Barney: Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.
19157,63,3,19,Abby: Really?
19158,63,3,19,"Barney: Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning."
19159,63,3,19,"Abby: Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this."
19160,63,3,19,"Barney: Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later."
19161,63,3,19,"Marshall: Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com."
19162,63,3,19,Lily: We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles
19163,63,3,19,Marshall: You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.
19164,63,3,19,Lily & Marshall: Thanks.
19165,64,3,20,??? of the cab ride that changed my life.
19166,64,3,20,"I know it sounds crazy, but for all I know my life would be very different if I had taken, say... that cab."
19167,64,3,20,Or that cab.
19168,64,3,20,God knows what would have happened if I had gotten into that cab.
19169,64,3,20,I took this cab.
19170,64,3,20,And it changed my whole life.
19171,64,3,20,"But first, we need to back up a little."
19172,64,3,20,Hey.
19173,64,3,20,Is there any beer in the fridge?
19174,64,3,20,It's 10:00 in the morning.
19175,64,3,20,Grab me one.
19176,64,3,20,"So, something bad just happened."
19177,64,3,20,Stella and I were out having breakfast.
19178,64,3,20,"So, my sister broke up with her boyfriend."
19179,64,3,20,"Well, I can finally say it."
19180,64,3,20,I hated that guy!
19181,64,3,20,"Everything out of his mouth is, ""I'm a vegan. ""Fish feel pain."
19182,64,3,20,"I'm never constipated. """
19183,64,3,20,The guy's an idiot.
19184,64,3,20,"Actually, she's marrying him."
19185,64,3,20,I just wanted your honest opinion.
19186,64,3,20,He's actually a really nice guy.
19187,64,3,20,I think there's a wisdom to...
19188,64,3,20,"Anyway, they picked a date, so, uh, you want to come with me, so that we can laugh our asses off as we watch him walk barefoot down the aisle in a hemp tuxedo?"
19189,64,3,20,"Yeah, sure. When is it?"
19190,64,3,20,"Uh, first weekend in November."
19191,64,3,20,Is that
19192,64,3,20,the something bad?
19193,64,3,20,That she invited you to a wedding?
19194,64,3,20,Six months from now.
19195,64,3,20,As in we'll be together six months from now.
19196,64,3,20,Do you guys remember Barney's whole thing about making plans in a relationship?
19197,64,3,20,Fourth row.
19198,64,3,20,"Ted, no."
19199,64,3,20,You're violating the date-time continuum.
19200,64,3,20,You never make plans with a girl further in the future than the amount of time you've been going out.
19201,64,3,20,"You've been dating this girl for, what, two weeks?"
19202,64,3,20,"No, you're not taking her to a Springsteen concert in January."
19203,64,3,20,By that time you won't even remember this Robin girl's name.
19204,64,3,20,"Ugh, man, I love Springsteen!"
19205,64,3,20,He's like the American Bryan Adams.
19206,64,3,20,Well...
19207,64,3,20,But Barney had a point.
19208,64,3,20,"As soon as she started talking about the wedding, it freaked me out."
19209,64,3,20,"Oh, that sounds like so much fun."
19210,64,3,20,Mmm. So I get to look forward to it for six months.
19211,64,3,20,Which is twice as long as we've been dating.
19212,64,3,20,Uh-oh.
19213,64,3,20,I'm sure your daughter Lucy'll come so it'll be like a... a family trip.
19214,64,3,20,Our first trip as our funny little family.
19215,64,3,20,So that... that'll be super-exciting.
19216,64,3,20,"Oh, boy."
19217,64,3,20,"Man, they crank up the heat in these places."
19218,64,3,20,"What's going on, Ted?"
19219,64,3,20,We need to talk.
19220,64,3,20,"Oh. Oh. Oh. ""We need to talk""?"
19221,64,3,20,"There's only two situations where you say that to someone and unless you're pregnant, it sounds like you broke up with her."
19222,64,3,20,"Yeah, I did."
19223,64,3,20,So how did she take it?
19224,64,3,20,Um...
19225,64,3,20,I'm only trying to be honest with you.
19226,64,3,20,"You know, Ted. I have to go to work."
19227,64,3,20,"Stella, can we just..."
19228,64,3,20,I d't want to leave it like this.
19229,64,3,20,"No, Ted, it's okay."
19230,64,3,20,We're good.
19231,64,3,20,Ow!
19232,64,3,20,"Look, I know it sounds rough, but Stella's a mom."
19233,64,3,20,I have to be responsible.
19234,64,3,20,"If I'm having these feelings now, what if they don't go away?"
19235,64,3,20,"What if they just get worse and worse d six months from now, I break up with her over tofu salmon at her sister's wedding?"
19236,64,3,20,I can't do that to her.
19237,64,3,20,And I definitely can't do that to her daughter.
19238,64,3,20,"It sucks, but I'm being the good guy here."
19239,64,3,20,This is the right decision.
19240,64,3,20,Which brings me back to the cab ride.
19241,64,3,20,"Hello, may I speak with Marshall Eriksen?"
19242,64,3,20,"Hey, guys."
19243,64,3,20,Jell-O?
19244,64,3,20,How I Met Your Mother Jimmy
19245,64,3,20,???t believe this. So you're totally fine.
19246,64,3,20,"No, I'm not fine."
19247,64,3,20,I made the biggest mistake of my life.
19248,64,3,20,I want Stella back.
19249,64,3,20,"I've left her like ten messages, but her phone's off."
19250,64,3,20,She's at that arcade Kiddie Funland with her daughter.
19251,64,3,20,Please.
19252,64,3,20,Let me go to Kiddie Funland.
19253,64,3,20,"You can say that all you want, buddy, but you're not getting any morphine."
19254,64,3,20,"No, I'm serious. I got to get out of here."
19255,64,3,20,You're not going anywhere until we get the tests back.
19256,64,3,20,You could have internal bleeding.
19257,64,3,20,Your brain could be all full of blood.
19258,64,3,20,Think that's good for it? ain't.
19259,64,3,20,This sucks.
19260,64,3,20,This sucks. This sucks. Are you... are you kidding me?
19261,64,3,20,You walked away from a car accident without a scratch.
19262,64,3,20,A miracle took place today.
19263,64,3,20,"Oh, here we go."
19264,64,3,20,You don't think this was a miracle?
19265,64,3,20,There's no such thing as miracles.
19266,64,3,20,"March 2006, MacLaren's Bar."
19267,64,3,20,Oh.
19268,64,3,20,That's terrible. Gentle.
19269,64,3,20,That's in! Gentle.
19270,64,3,20,Ow. Here we go.
19271,64,3,20,Hey!
19272,64,3,20,Bravo.
19273,64,3,20,Cheers...
19274,64,3,20,Mm-hmm.
19275,64,3,20,No... way.
19276,64,3,20,That did not just happen.
19277,64,3,20,Am I dead?
19278,64,3,20,Miracle!
19279,64,3,20,"A pencil went up Barney's nose, and you call it a miracle."
19280,64,3,20,"Well, do you have a better explanation for it?"
19281,64,3,20,A drunk jackass with a box of pencils?
19282,64,3,20,"A drunk jackass called ""God!"""
19283,64,3,20,"And a box of pencils called ""destiny!"""
19284,64,3,20,"Speaking of Barney, I should give him a call."
19285,64,3,20,Why? We're not friends anymore.
19286,64,3,20,You'd want to know if thisappened to him.
19287,64,3,20,Go for Barney.
19288,64,3,20,"Hey, Barney."
19289,64,3,20,"Listen, I have something to tell you."
19290,64,3,20,"Oh, boy, here we go."
19291,64,3,20,I've been waiting for this one.
19292,64,3,20,You talked to Robin.
19293,64,3,20,She told you what's under the hood and you want to take it for a spin yourself.
19294,64,3,20,Not even if you boiled it in detergent.
19295,64,3,20,It's about Ted.
19296,64,3,20,Ted?
19297,64,3,20,My former best friend Ted who I asked you never to mention to me again?
19298,64,3,20,Yeah.
19299,64,3,20,He's been in a car accident.
19300,64,3,20,He's at Saint Anthony's hospital.
19301,64,3,20,Everything's...
19302,64,3,20,"No, I understand."
19303,64,3,20,You've got that important thing.
19304,64,3,20,Okay.
19305,64,3,20,"Oh, of course I'll tell him you love him."
19306,64,3,20,Okay.
19307,64,3,20,Suit up!
19308,64,3,20,He is always saying stuff like that!
19309,64,3,20,"He hung up, didn't he? Yeah."
19310,64,3,20,"See, I told you. We're not friends anymore."
19311,64,3,20,??????
19312,64,3,20,What did he say?
19313,64,3,20,"Ah, a hundred and thir... What?"
19314,64,3,20,You...
19315,64,3,20,"I'm coming, Ted."
19316,64,3,20,"So, what made you change your mind about Stella?"
19317,64,3,20,"Well, I was in the cab, and the car was coming at me, and you know how they say that your whole life flashes before your eyes in a near-death experience?"
19318,64,3,20,It doesn't.
19319,64,3,20,You don't see everything.
19320,64,3,20,Just the things you love.
19321,64,3,20,I realized in that moment that Stella is the most important thing in my life and-and I have to get her back.
19322,64,3,20,Aw!
19323,64,3,20,Miracle!
19324,64,3,20,Very sweet.
19325,64,3,20,Very romantic.
19326,64,3,20,Not a miracle.
19327,64,3,20,July 1999.
19328,64,3,20,Kennedy Airport.
19329,64,3,20,"So, did you enjoy..."
19330,64,3,20,Amsterdam?
19331,64,3,20,No.
19332,64,3,20,Nothing illegal.
19333,64,3,20,Paintings.
19334,64,3,20,"All right, Bob Marley."
19335,64,3,20,Let's have a conversation.
19336,64,3,20,Shift change.
19337,64,3,20,"Oh, Amsterdam."
19338,64,3,20,All right.
19339,64,3,20,"Float on through, brother."
19340,64,3,20,Miracle!
19341,64,3,20,Don't you go into the light!
19342,64,3,20,Don't you do it!
19343,64,3,20,"Hey, Mosby, you got a visitor."
19344,64,3,20,"Hey, guys."
19345,64,3,20,Hey. Hey. Hey.
19346,64,3,20,"Can you guys, uh, give us a minute?"
19347,64,3,20,"Stella, before you say anytng..."
19348,64,3,20,I love you.
19349,64,3,20,"I love you, too."
19350,64,3,20,Can we just forget about...
19351,64,3,20,It's forgotten.
19352,64,3,20,Is this your chart?
19353,64,3,20,Okay.
19354,64,3,20,Uh-huh.
19355,64,3,20,Everything looks good.
19356,64,3,20,I think you can handle it.
19357,64,3,20,Handle what?
19358,64,3,20,Aww! Aww! Aww!
19359,64,3,20,This morning he dumped her and now she's dry-humping him on a hospital bed.
19360,64,3,20,"Miracle! Yeah, you know, I bet if you call up the Vatican, they will tell you that most of their certified miracles involve dry-humping, so."
19361,64,3,20,April 2008.
19362,64,3,20,Lily's kindergarten classroom.
19363,64,3,20,You're gonna go in there and beg for your old job back?
19364,64,3,20,That's crazy.
19365,64,3,20,You hated it there.
19366,64,3,20,"I- I know, the job market is just really bad right now."
19367,64,3,20,"Hey, kids, who wants Uncle Marshall to get his old job back?"
19368,64,3,20,They'll cheer for anything if you say it like that.
19369,64,3,20,"Kids, a super tanker spilled five million gallons of oil off the coast of Alaska this morning!"
19370,64,3,20,"Hello, Marshall."
19371,64,3,20,"Mr. Hewitt, I came here to apologize."
19372,64,3,20,I'm going to go grab some more glue.
19373,64,3,20,Will you watch them for a sec?
19374,64,3,20,Of course.
19375,64,3,20,"Leaving Nicholson, Hewitt, and West was a huge mistake, and I can see that now."
19376,64,3,20,So... who wants to see the big guy put on these tiny hats?
19377,64,3,20,My behavior was disrespectful.
19378,64,3,20,It was unprofessional.
19379,64,3,20,I'm a pilgrim.
19380,64,3,20,"I know it looks like I have a tiny hat, but in reality, I have an abnormally large head!"
19381,64,3,20,I was going through a stressful time.
19382,64,3,20,I wasn't getting enough sleep.
19383,64,3,20,"Fourscore and seven years ago, I had a great, big giant head!"
19384,64,3,20,"I had just bought an apartment, and there were some problems."
19385,64,3,20,I- I don't want to bore you with the details.
19386,64,3,20,I only regret that I have but one giant head to give for my country.
19387,64,3,20,
19388,64,3,20,"Sir, if you could just see your way into giving me one more chance, I promise... Marshall."
19389,64,3,20,I'm willing to give this a second chance.
19390,64,3,20,I remember my first years as an attorney.
19391,64,3,20,"Why, I don't know how many hours I spent."
19392,64,3,20,I don't think I ever left...
19393,64,3,20,"Oh, my God!"
19394,64,3,20,I have lice.
19395,64,3,20,Those little bastards gave me lice.
19396,64,3,20,"God, it itches."
19397,64,3,20,Don't scratch it.
19398,64,3,20,You'll look like a fool.
19399,64,3,20,You'll never get your job back.
19400,64,3,20,"Okay, you can scratch, but just make it subtle."
19401,64,3,20,"Okay, that's not working."
19402,64,3,20,", sweet, sharp corner of the desk, how I long to rub my infested scalp against you."
19403,64,3,20,"I was, um... just, uh..."
19404,64,3,20,"You okay, Eriksen?"
19405,64,3,20,"Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good."
19406,64,3,20,I am good.
19407,64,3,20,Continue.
19408,64,3,20,Mind over matter.
19409,64,3,20,"There are no lice in my hair... laying eggs, burrowing into my scalp,"
19410,64,3,20,eating their way all the way down to my brain![/i]
19411,64,3,20,I have lice!
19412,64,3,20,"""Lice""?! Lice! Get out!"
19413,64,3,20,Get out of my office!
19414,64,3,20,We've got lice!
19415,64,3,20,Everybody out of the building.
19416,64,3,20,"If it weren't for the lice, I would have gotten my job back, and I would have been working there when,"
19417,64,3,20,"two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission came a-knocking."
19418,64,3,20,God sent those lice to my head like he sent the locusts to Egypt:
19419,64,3,20,to liberate me from corporate bondage.
19420,64,3,20,Miracle.
19421,64,3,20,"Hey, guys."
19422,64,3,20,"Oh, I'm just so glad you and Ted are back together. Yeah."
19423,64,3,20,"Wait, um, what do you mean ""back together""?"
19424,64,3,20,"Well, you know, since you guys broke up."
19425,64,3,20,"What? Oh, no."
19426,64,3,20,It was just a small fight.
19427,64,3,20,That wasn't a breakup.
19428,64,3,20,Was that a breakup? Did he think that was a breakup?
19429,64,3,20,What?
19430,64,3,20,Son of a bitch!
19431,64,3,20,That was a breakup. Wasn't it?
19432,64,3,20,You broke up with me.
19433,64,3,20,Yeah.
19434,64,3,20,I didn't know that that was a breakup.
19435,64,3,20,Are you kidding?
19436,64,3,20,"I- I said, ""I feel awful. """
19437,64,3,20,"You said, ""We're good. """
19438,64,3,20,Then you got up and left.
19439,64,3,20,"Yeah, I said, ""We're good, "" as in ""We're good. """
19440,64,3,20,"Like when the waiter comes around and asks if you want any more muffins, and you say, ""We're good. """
19441,64,3,20,"Exactly, and I took that ""We're good"" to mean you didn't want any more metaphorical relationship muffins."
19442,64,3,20,This is crazy.
19443,64,3,20,Forget about all that.
19444,64,3,20,That was a whole life-changing car accident ago.
19445,64,3,20,I love you.
19446,64,3,20,I don't want to break up.
19447,64,3,20,But you did.
19448,64,3,20,You did want to.
19449,64,3,20,"And if you had those feelings once, then you're going to have those feelings again, and you're going to keep on having them."
19450,64,3,20,And I can't count on that car to hit you every time you do.
19451,64,3,20,What are you saying?
19452,64,3,20,"I'm saying... you wanted your breakup, you got it."
19453,64,3,20,"What?! Stella, wait!"
19454,64,3,20,"No, you know what, Ted?"
19455,64,3,20,???
19456,64,3,20,So you broke up with her and she didn't know it?
19457,64,3,20,Apparently.
19458,64,3,20,"And you actually said, ""I want to break up""?"
19459,64,3,20,"No, of course not."
19460,64,3,20,"Who says ""I want to break up""?"
19461,64,3,20,That's a horrible thing to say.
19462,64,3,20,"Well, that's true."
19463,64,3,20,Hello?
19464,64,3,20,"Hi, Ted Mosby? We have you listed as the emergency contact for Barney Stinson."
19465,64,3,20,What is it?
19466,64,3,20,What it was was this.
19467,64,3,20,I made it. I made it!
19468,64,3,20,"Dude, I..."
19469,64,3,20,I can't believe you ran all the way up here.
19470,64,3,20,Jeez. Flatter yourself much?
19471,64,3,20,What an ego on this guy.
19472,64,3,20,"Um, I was up in this part of town because I had to attend a very important international business meeting."
19473,64,3,20,"If you're here to come crawling back, just save it."
19474,64,3,20,I'm doing awesome without you.
19475,64,3,20,"Even br now, 'cause I can play the sympathy card with the females."
19476,64,3,20,"And BTW, there's one bone downstairs that ain't broken."
19477,64,3,20,"Marshall, you know what I'm talking about."
19478,64,3,20,Up top!
19479,64,3,20,Hup!
19480,64,3,20,Are you sure?
19481,64,3,20,"Yeah, dude. Why do y think I had them set it this way?"
19482,64,3,20,Okay.
19483,64,3,20,Ow!
19484,64,3,20,Worth it.
19485,64,3,20,"Barney, you, uh..."
19486,64,3,20,Yocould've died.
19487,64,3,20,"Ted, I'm sorry I broke the bro code."
19488,64,3,20,"No, I'm-I'm sorry."
19489,64,3,20,"Ted, can we be friends again?"
19490,64,3,20,"Barney, come on, we're... we're more than friends."
19491,64,3,20,We're brothers.
19492,64,3,20,"You're my brother, Ted. You're my brother, Barney."
19493,64,3,20,"Did you hear that, Marshall?"
19494,64,3,20,We're brothers now.
19495,64,3,20,"Marshall's my brother, too."
19496,64,3,20,We're all brothers.
19497,64,3,20,"Yeah, but I'm your best brother, right?"
19498,64,3,20,And that's how your Uncle Barney and I buried the hatchet.
19499,64,3,20,It got pretty mushy and embarrassing after that.
19500,64,3,20,Let's skip ahead.
19501,64,3,20,"I had to look away because if I watched what the paramedics were about to do, I would have passed out."
19502,64,3,20,"Then they took out this electric blade thing and I kept thinking, ""This isn't happening. This isn't happening. """
19503,64,3,20,"Oh, my God. What did they cut?"
19504,64,3,20,My suit.
19505,64,3,20,My beautiful suit.
19506,64,3,20,"But you're alive, and, and Ted's alive."
19507,64,3,20,This is amazing!
19508,64,3,20,Two miracles in one day.
19509,64,3,20,What is the matter with you?
19510,64,3,20,How can you possibly be this cynical?!
19511,64,3,20,You want to know? Yeah.
19512,64,3,20,You really want to know? Yeah!
19513,64,3,20,Fine.
19514,64,3,20,"When I was a kid, I had this dog, Sir Scratchawan."
19515,64,3,20,"Anyway, Sir Scratchawan got really old, so my parents decided to put him down."
19516,64,3,20,It was the toughest day of my young life.
19517,64,3,20,Good-byI love you.
19518,64,3,20,"And when they took him to the vet, he told them that earlier that very day, he had learned about an experimental procedure called a canine/testudine cerebro-xenograft."
19519,64,3,20,Ever heard of it?
19520,64,3,20,No.
19521,64,3,20,"Well, it saved Sir Scratchawan's life."
19522,64,3,20,He lived another seven years.
19523,64,3,20,Miracle. Except for one... kind of big side effect from the surgery.
19524,64,3,20,SiScratchawan!
19525,64,3,20,Welcome home!
19526,64,3,20,He turned into a turtle.
19527,64,3,20,"I know. It's weird, right?"
19528,64,3,20,"Apparently, a very common complication from canine/testudine cerebro-xenografts."
19529,64,3,20,And he didn't seem to remember any of his old tricks.
19530,64,3,20,"Go get it, Scratchy."
19531,64,3,20,Go get it!
19532,64,3,20,Go get it! Get it!
19533,64,3,20,"Go get it, Scratchy."
19534,64,3,20,Go get it.
19535,64,3,20,How long was it before...?
19536,64,3,20,"Longer than I'm proud of, Lily."
19537,64,3,20,Longer than I'm proud of.
19538,64,3,20,And that's when I realized miracles ain't real.
19539,64,3,20,Excuse me.
19540,64,3,20,"Mosby, you're still here?"
19541,64,3,20,"Your tests came back, like, an hour ago. You're fine."
19542,64,3,20,Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me?!
19543,64,3,20,I'm sorry.
19544,64,3,20,I guess it was rude of me to keep resuscitating that guy with a rake sticking out of his chest.
19545,64,3,20,"Um, I have to go right now. Barney, I..."
19546,64,3,20,Go.
19547,64,3,20,"Run, Ted. Run."
19548,64,3,20,"If there's anything I've taught you over the years, it's..."
19549,64,3,20,"Barney, he left. Oh."
19550,64,3,20,"Hey, Ted said that right before the accident, his life flashed before his eyes."
19551,64,3,20,"You know, all the stuff he loves."
19552,64,3,20,"Did that happen to you? Oh, yeah."
19553,64,3,20,I know what he saw: boobs. Scotch.
19554,64,3,20,And money.
19555,64,3,20,Suits. A suit of money.
19556,64,3,20,A suit of boobs.
19557,64,3,20,A giant boob wearing a suit of money.
19558,64,3,20,And the boob is lactating scotch.
19559,64,3,20,"I guess that's pretty much everything you love, right?"
19560,64,3,20,"Yeah, pretty much."
19561,64,3,20,"Kids, a lot of weird, random things have happened in my life,"
19562,64,3,20,"but that car accident is one of the few I'd call a miracle, not because of what happened, but because of what happened next.[/i]"
19563,64,3,20,Hi.
19564,64,3,20,Hi.
19565,64,3,20,Can I talk to you?
19566,64,3,20,Okay.
19567,64,3,20,I got you this orange kangaroo.
19568,64,3,20,Uh... thanks.
19569,64,3,20,So I've been thinking about what changed from the moment I broke up with you to the moment I knew I wanted you back.
19570,64,3,20,"And, um, I think I finally figured out what happened."
19571,64,3,20,Your cab got T-boned by a jackass on a cell phone?
19572,64,3,20,No. I changed.
19573,64,3,20,I'm ready to give you what you need.
19574,64,3,20,"That's why I spent ten minutes on the damn claw machine trying to get the big, fake diamond ring."
19575,64,3,20,But all I could get was this orange kangaroo.
19576,64,3,20,Diamond ring?
19577,65,4,1,"Ted(2030): Kids, there is something I wish my dad told me. The longest pause you will ever experience in your life is the one that follows asking the question..."
19578,65,4,1,Ted is in a playroom with Stella...
19579,65,4,1,Ted: Will you marry me?
19580,65,4,1,"Ted(2030): Your brain goes into overdrive, imaging every possible response."
19581,65,4,1,Stella: No.
19582,65,4,1,"Stella: Oh, God, no."
19583,65,4,1,Stella: You want me to marry..(laughing).No.
19584,65,4,1,"Stella: Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't. Mark Johnson, the quarterback from your high school football team, already asked me."
19585,65,4,1,"Mark Johnson: What's up, Turd?"
19586,65,4,1,Ted: It's Ted!
19587,65,4,1,"Ted (2030): But if you're lucky, she may answer with the single greatest word in the English language."
19588,65,4,1,Stella: Yes.
19589,65,4,1,CREDITS
19590,65,4,1,Ted (2030): Stella and I spent that summer happily engaged. Marshall was still coping with unemployment.
19591,65,4,1,Marshall to lily: What are you doing?
19592,65,4,1,Ted(2030): Lily threw herself into her painting.
19593,65,4,1,Marshall to Barney: What are you doing?
19594,65,4,1,Ted(2030): Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident.
19595,65,4,1,Marshall to himself: What are you doing?
19596,65,4,1,"Ted(2030): And well, Marshall just kept coping with unemployment."
19597,65,4,1,Marshall to Robin: What are you doing?
19598,65,4,1,Ted(2030): And Robin continued to uphold the high journalistic standards of Metro News 1.
19599,65,4,1,Robin: Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking... Tooth.
19600,65,4,1,At the bar...
19601,65,4,1,"Robin: Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter."
19602,65,4,1,"Barney: ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke."
19603,65,4,1,"Lily: Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny."
19604,65,4,1,"Barney: Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. ""Bogeyman with a teleprompter."" Classic."
19605,65,4,1,Lily is at Barney's apartment...
19606,65,4,1,"Lily: Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?"
19607,65,4,1,"Barney: I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?"
19608,65,4,1,"Lily: Barney, just say it."
19609,65,4,1,Barney: I think I'm in love with Robin.
19610,65,4,1,At the apartment...
19611,65,4,1,"Marshall: Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella's wedding shower. Does she like to cook?"
19612,65,4,1,"Ted: Actually, I don't know."
19613,65,4,1,Marshall: What's her favorite color?
19614,65,4,1,Ted: Don't know that either.
19615,65,4,1,"Marshall: Well, does she have any hobbies?"
19616,65,4,1,"Ted: Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch."
19617,65,4,1,"Marshall: Dude, you don't know anything about the woman you're marrying."
19618,65,4,1,Ted: What? You're crazy! I know plenty.
19619,65,4,1,Marshall: What color are her eyes?
19620,65,4,1,Ted: The color of the ocean after a storm.
19621,65,4,1,Marshall: Which is?
19622,65,4,1,Ted: Beautiful.
19623,65,4,1,At Barney's apartment...
19624,65,4,1,"Lily: I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your s*x swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!"
19625,65,4,1,"Barney: It's not ""sweet."" It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything."
19626,65,4,1,"Lily: Barney, you don't ""catch"" feelings, you just have them. And they're good."
19627,65,4,1,"Barney: They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin."
19628,65,4,1,Girl: Morning.
19629,65,4,1,"Barney: I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin."
19630,65,4,1,At the apartment...
19631,65,4,1,"Ted: Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?"
19632,65,4,1,"Marshall: No, Ted, I like Stella a lot. She's a Mets fan."
19633,65,4,1,Ted: Really?
19634,65,4,1,Marshall: It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?
19635,65,4,1,"Ted: I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to: that I love her."
19636,65,4,1,At Barney's apartment...
19637,65,4,1,"Lily: You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?"
19638,65,4,1,"Barney: I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, ""How can an ant carry ""20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?"" Are the two even related? Really?"
19639,65,4,1,"Lily: Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend."
19640,65,4,1,"Barney: ""Boyfriend""? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend."
19641,65,4,1,"Lily: Well, what do you want, then?"
19642,65,4,1,Barney: I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.
19643,65,4,1,"Lily: Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that."
19644,65,4,1,"Barney: Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?"
19645,65,4,1,"Lily: I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?"
19646,65,4,1,Barney: Deal.
19647,65,4,1,At Metro News One...
19648,65,4,1,"Robin: Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?"
19649,65,4,1,"At the apartment, Ted and Stella are eating..."
19650,65,4,1,"Stella: I know dudes think it's girlie for a guy to cook, but us ladies? We find it mighty sexy."
19651,65,4,1,Ted: Really? You know... My grandma taught me how.
19652,65,4,1,"Stella: Oh, yeah, she did."
19653,65,4,1,Ted: Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports.
19654,65,4,1,Stella: I'm on fire right now. Delicious. What's in this pesto?
19655,65,4,1,"Ted: Oh, you know, the usual: basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient?"
19656,65,4,1,Stella: Peanuts.
19657,65,4,1,Ted: Yes. How did you know that?
19658,65,4,1,Stella falls of her stair... A few moments later...
19659,65,4,1,"Ted: OK, let me think, what else?"
19660,65,4,1,"Stella: You know what, sweetie? I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work. And there was that whole thing where you tried to kill me. Can we please just go to sleep?"
19661,65,4,1,"Ted: No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss?"
19662,65,4,1,"Stella: Dale Harris, second grade. You're talking like peck on the cheek or a full-on passionate making out?"
19663,65,4,1,Ted. Passionate making out.
19664,65,4,1,"Stella: OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade."
19665,65,4,1,Ted: First time you had s*x.
19666,65,4,1,"Stella: Dale Harris, second..."
19667,65,4,1,Ted: Stop it.
19668,65,4,1,"Stella: Billy Devito, sophomore year of college."
19669,65,4,1,"Ted: Prude. Molly McKenzie, junior year of high school."
19670,65,4,1,Stella: Slut.
19671,65,4,1,At Barney's apartment...
19672,65,4,1,Lily: Robin just needs to see this new see of you.
19673,65,4,1,Barney: So just call her up?
19674,65,4,1,Lily: Just call her up.
19675,65,4,1,"Barney (on the phone): Hi, Robin..(he jabbers something and hang up) She wasn't there. I left a voice mail."
19676,65,4,1,"Lily: You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times."
19677,65,4,1,"Barney: Yeah, but those were just booty calls."
19678,65,4,1,Flashback.
19679,65,4,1,21h03. Barney's at the bar and calls someone...
19680,65,4,1,"Barney (present): On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say..."
19681,65,4,1,"Barney: Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait."
19682,65,4,1,"Barney (present): But the later it gets, the fewer words you need."
19683,65,4,1,Barney (on the phone) Barney. Busy? Sweet.
19684,65,4,1,Barney (present): And by 3:00 in the morning...
19685,65,4,1,The screan of Barney's phone shows a question mark followed by an exclamation mark.
19686,65,4,1,Barney: Sweet.
19687,65,4,1,End of flashback.
19688,65,4,1,Lily: A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?
19689,65,4,1,Barney: It's no worse than your super-obvious code words.
19690,65,4,1,Flashback. At the bar...
19691,65,4,1,Lily: Rhinoceros.
19692,65,4,1,Marshall: We have to go.
19693,65,4,1,End of flashback.
19694,65,4,1,Lily: Great. Now we need a new code word.
19695,65,4,1,Barney's phone rings
19696,65,4,1,"Barney: Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
19697,65,4,1,"Robin: You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?"
19698,65,4,1,Barney (to lily): Help me!
19699,65,4,1,Lily: Just ask her something.
19700,65,4,1,Barney: How are you feeling today?
19701,65,4,1,Robin: Fine.
19702,65,4,1,Lily: Something personal.
19703,65,4,1,Barney: At what age did you first get your period?
19704,65,4,1,Robin: Did you just ask me about about my period?
19705,65,4,1,"Barney: No, I did not."
19706,65,4,1,"Robin: Look, Barney, I'm at work right now."
19707,65,4,1,Lily: Just ask her out.
19708,65,4,1,"Barney: Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again."
19709,65,4,1,Lily looks and sees that there really is a camera...
19710,65,4,1,Lily: Gross.
19711,65,4,1,At the apartment
19712,65,4,1,Ted: First movie you ever saw.
19713,65,4,1,"Stella: Benji,1981. I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought, ""Oh, that dog is so dead right now."" What about you?"
19714,65,4,1,Ted: My dad took me to an old drive-in to see the original Star Wars.
19715,65,4,1,"Stella: You know, I've actually never seen Star Wars."
19716,65,4,1,Marshall and Ted are at the bar...
19717,65,4,1,"Marshall: She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars."
19718,65,4,1,Ted: You've got to calm down.
19719,65,4,1,"Marshall: I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?"
19720,65,4,1,"Ted: Dude, it's just a movie."
19721,65,4,1,"Marshall: Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are."
19722,65,4,1,Ted: It's just a movie. It's just a movie!
19723,65,4,1,
19724,65,4,1,121 awesome minutes later...
19725,65,4,1,"Ted: If Stella doesn't like this movie, I can't marry her."
19726,65,4,1,Marshall: You can't.
19727,65,4,1,Ted: You want to watch it again?
19728,65,4,1,Marshall: I do.
19729,65,4,1,Barney and Lily are at the restaurant. Robin's already there...
19730,65,4,1,Barney: Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing.
19731,65,4,1,Lily: I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.
19732,65,4,1,Barney: Why?
19733,65,4,1,"Lily: Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck."
19734,65,4,1,"Barney: Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot."
19735,65,4,1,Lily: We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.
19736,65,4,1,"Barney: You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?"
19737,65,4,1,Lily: Ted hit that for over a year.
19738,65,4,1,Barney: Wish me luck.
19739,65,4,1,Barney goes to the table where Robin is. At Ted's apartment...
19740,65,4,1,"Ted: I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good."
19741,65,4,1,Stella: Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?
19742,65,4,1,"Ted: The movie's already started, so..."
19743,65,4,1,Stella: It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.
19744,65,4,1,"Ted: Oh, my God. Marshall appears behind the couch."
19745,65,4,1,Marshall: Off to a bad start.
19746,65,4,1,Ted: What are you doing down there?
19747,65,4,1,Marshall: I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.
19748,65,4,1,"Ted: What are you doing, hiding behind the couch? You need to get a job."
19749,65,4,1,"Marshall: I really do, don't I?"
19750,65,4,1,At the restaurant...
19751,65,4,1,"Barney: So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened."
19752,65,4,1,Robin: What?
19753,65,4,1,"Barney: I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen."
19754,65,4,1,Robin: Why are you acting like this?
19755,65,4,1,Barney: Like what?
19756,65,4,1,"Robin: You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney."
19757,65,4,1,"Barney: I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful."
19758,65,4,1,Robin: Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.
19759,65,4,1,Barney: Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.
19760,65,4,1,"Robin: That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man."
19761,65,4,1,Barney: Your teeth look fantastic.
19762,65,4,1,Robin: Who are you?
19763,65,4,1,At the apartment...
19764,65,4,1,Stella: What?
19765,65,4,1,Ted: Nothing.
19766,65,4,1,Stella: You were staring at me.
19767,65,4,1,Ted: You look really beautiful tonight.
19768,65,4,1,"Stella: You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck"
19769,65,4,1,"Ted: Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology."
19770,65,4,1,"Stella: Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?"
19771,65,4,1,Ted: Nothing.
19772,65,4,1,"Stella: Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go."
19773,65,4,1,Ted goes to his room. Marshall stands up from behind the couch which scares Stella and makes her drop the popcorn.
19774,65,4,1,"Marshall: Should I leave, too?"
19775,65,4,1,"Ted: What part, what part?"
19776,65,4,1,"At the restaurant, the waitress leans over to pour the wine and shows her cleavage to Barney, but he leans over and looks at Robin."
19777,65,4,1,Barney: Thanks.
19778,65,4,1,Robin: Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?
19779,65,4,1,"Barney: I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously."
19780,65,4,1,"Robin: There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply."
19781,65,4,1,Barney: Why not?
19782,65,4,1,Robin: Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.
19783,65,4,1,Barney: We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.
19784,65,4,1,Robin: It's not as easy...
19785,65,4,1,Barney: Promise me you'll apply.
19786,65,4,1,Robin: I promise.
19787,65,4,1,Ted and Marshall are in Ted's room.
19788,65,4,1,"Marshall: She's up to the scene where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's trash compactor."
19789,65,4,1,Ted: Great scene.
19790,65,4,1,"Marshall: Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep."
19791,65,4,1,Ted: I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.
19792,65,4,1,Marshall: I'll tell her you still want to be friends.
19793,65,4,1,"Ted: I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) ""Stop watching me, jackasses."""
19794,65,4,1,At the restaurant.
19795,65,4,1,Barney: To taking chances.
19796,65,4,1,Robin: To taking chances.
19797,65,4,1,"Barney: You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about."
19798,65,4,1,Barman: Last call.
19799,65,4,1,Barney: Of course it is. One more for the road?
19800,65,4,1,"Robin: Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?"
19801,65,4,1,Barney ; I will.
19802,65,4,1,Ted and Marshall are in the room. Stella comes in.
19803,65,4,1,Stella: I loved it.
19804,65,4,1,Ted: Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.
19805,65,4,1,Stella: What was that?
19806,65,4,1,"Ted: I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you masturbating little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room."
19807,65,4,1,Stella: It was so good.
19808,65,4,1,"Marshall: You hated it, didn't you?"
19809,65,4,1,"Stella: It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?"
19810,65,4,1,Marshall: Wookiee.
19811,65,4,1,"Stella: He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, ""That's a good point, Bear, ""let's try that."""
19812,65,4,1,"Marshall: He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?"
19813,65,4,1,Stella: I do.
19814,65,4,1,"Marshall: Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear."
19815,65,4,1,At the restaurant. Robin comes back and Barney has two glasses.
19816,65,4,1,"Barney: So, here's the deal."
19817,65,4,1,"Robin: April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam."
19818,65,4,1,Barney: Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?
19819,65,4,1,"Robin: You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun."
19820,65,4,1,April: So are you... nervous about the game?
19821,65,4,1,"Barney: Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go."
19822,65,4,1,Lily's at Barney's apartment.
19823,65,4,1,Barney: And that was it.
19824,65,4,1,"Lily: I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you..."
19825,65,4,1,"April: When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?"
19826,65,4,1,"Barney: My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true."
19827,65,4,1,"Lily: Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now."
19828,65,4,1,Barney: I choose bimbos.
19829,65,4,1,Lily: What?
19830,65,4,1,"Barney: Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos."
19831,65,4,1,"Lily: This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused."
19832,65,4,1,"Barney: Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?"
19833,65,4,1,"Lily: See you, Barney."
19834,66,4,2,"Ted from 2030: When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank."
19835,66,4,2,At Ted and Marshall's apartment
19836,66,4,2,"Barney: Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!"
19837,66,4,2,"Ted: Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?"
19838,66,4,2,"Barney: Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job."
19839,66,4,2,"Lily: Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer."
19840,66,4,2,"Ted from 2030: That was the plan, anyway. (We can see Marshall in front of the mirror of the bathroom.) Over the next few weeks, Marshall went on a lot of interviews."
19841,66,4,2,"Marshall (to the mirror): You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused!"
19842,66,4,2,Ted from 2030: A lot of interviews.
19843,66,4,2,"Marshall(to the mirror): You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time."
19844,66,4,2,Ted from 2030: Too many interviews.
19845,66,4,2,"Marshall(to the mirror): You are sad, you are beaten down, you will get through this, come home, get in your big underpants and take a nap."
19846,66,4,2,"Ted from 2030: Which brings us to September 29, the night of the burger."
19847,66,4,2,At McLaren's
19848,66,4,2,"Ted: So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?"
19849,66,4,2,"Wendy: Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing."
19850,66,4,2,"Robin: Great, we'll take five of those."
19851,66,4,2,Wendy (taking note): Five burgers.
19852,66,4,2,Ted: Really? You want to eat here?
19853,66,4,2,"Robin: Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse."
19854,66,4,2,Marshall: I thought you started that yesterday.
19855,66,4,2,"Robin: I finished early, OK? (To Wendy) Five of those."
19856,66,4,2,Wendy: Five burgers.
19857,66,4,2,Ted: Wait. What about sushi?
19858,66,4,2,Lily: We had sushi last night.
19859,66,4,2,Barney: Italian.
19860,66,4,2,Ted: I had Italian for lunch.
19861,66,4,2,Wendy: I can come back.
19862,66,4,2,"Robin: No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?"
19863,66,4,2,Ted: Chinese?
19864,66,4,2,Robin: Oh.
19865,66,4,2,Barney: I don't like Chinese.
19866,66,4,2,Ted: Indian?
19867,66,4,2,Barney: I just said I don't like Chinese.
19868,66,4,2,Ted: Indian isn't Chinese.
19869,66,4,2,"Barney: Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?"
19870,66,4,2,Ted: Mexican?
19871,66,4,2,Barney: I just said I don't like Chinese.
19872,66,4,2,Robin: God.
19873,66,4,2,Credit title
19874,66,4,2,Wendy serves everybody except Robin.
19875,66,4,2,"Wendy: Robin, yours will be right out."
19876,66,4,2,"Robin: Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me."
19877,66,4,2,Everybody: Sweet! You shouldn't have. That's so kind of you.
19878,66,4,2,"Lily: My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas."
19879,66,4,2,Ted: It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.
19880,66,4,2,"Barney: I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut."
19881,66,4,2,Marshall: It's okay.
19882,66,4,2,Everybody: Are you kidding me?
19883,66,4,2,"Marshall: Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet."
19884,66,4,2,Robin: And you've had the best burger in New York?
19885,66,4,2,"Marshall: It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place."
19886,66,4,2,[Flashback - Eight years earlier]
19887,66,4,2,At Ted and Marshall's apartment
19888,66,4,2,Marshall waits behind the door with a bat of baseball in hands. When Ted opens the door and is surprised by his friend.
19889,66,4,2,"Marshall: Oh, thank God it's just you."
19890,66,4,2,"Ted: You are being ridiculous. (Taking the bat.) Tell me, you left the apartment today?"
19891,66,4,2,"Marshall: Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? (Laughing) It's disgusting."
19892,66,4,2,"Ted: Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged."
19893,66,4,2,"Marshall: What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang."
19894,66,4,2,"Ted: That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go."
19895,66,4,2,"Marshall: No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable."
19896,66,4,2,"Ted: Go outside, go, go."
19897,66,4,2,Marshall: Okay. (He takes the bat discreetly.)
19898,66,4,2,Ted: Leave the bat.
19899,66,4,2,Marshall: Fine.
19900,66,4,2,In the streets
19901,66,4,2,"Marshal: So I went for a walk in the big, scary city. And I discovered something amazing: it wasn't scary at all. All right. What's the word?"
19902,66,4,2,Man in the street (Distributing pamphlets): Your search is over!
19903,66,4,2,"Marshall: And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner..."
19904,66,4,2,[End of Flashback]
19905,66,4,2,At McLaren's
19906,66,4,2,Marshall: And there it was.
19907,66,4,2,"The tiniest little burger joint you ever saw, tucked between a taxidermist and a triple-X bookstore."
19908,66,4,2,Barney: Name two places where things get stuffed.
19909,66,4,2,"Marshall: So, I went inside."
19910,66,4,2,[Flashback - Eight years earlier]
19911,66,4,2,Marshall voiceover: And I ordered the burger.
19912,66,4,2,A man tattooed from head to foot brings him his plate.
19913,66,4,2,Marshal: Thank you.
19914,66,4,2,"Marshall starts eating his burger. He feasts, and raises the head towards the wall. His glance settles on Regis Philbin's photo. Then, Marshall runs through streets, returns to the apartment."
19915,66,4,2,There he wakes Ted.
19916,66,4,2,"Marshall: Ted, you got to wake up. Wake..."
19917,66,4,2,Ted is surprised and he hits Marshall with the bat.
19918,66,4,2,"Ted: Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?"
19919,66,4,2,"Marshall: I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude."
19920,66,4,2,Ted: I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?
19921,66,4,2,Marshall: I don't know. (Looking to his watch.) Does stuff in New York stay open past... 9:30?
19922,66,4,2,Ted and Marshall are walking in the New York's streets.
19923,66,4,2,Marshall voiceover: So we went out to get another burger. But after hours of searching...
19924,66,4,2,Marshall (Raising hands in the sky.): Damn it! Where is this place?
19925,66,4,2,[End of Flashback]
19926,66,4,2,At McLaren's
19927,66,4,2,Robin: You couldn't find it?
19928,66,4,2,Ted: We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.
19929,66,4,2,"Marshall: Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?"
19930,66,4,2,Robin: Where do you think it was?
19931,66,4,2,Lily: Probably tucked between her legs.
19932,66,4,2,They laugh.
19933,66,4,2,Barney: You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.
19934,66,4,2,"Marshall: Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger."
19935,66,4,2,A man who sat at the table behind them calls to Marshall.
19936,66,4,2,Man: I couldn't help but overhear.
19937,66,4,2,"Marshall: Okay, here we go."
19938,66,4,2,Man: I know the place you're talking about.
19939,66,4,2,"Marshall: No, you don't."
19940,66,4,2,Man: It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger.
19941,66,4,2,"Marshall: Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee: Starbucks."
19942,66,4,2,"Irritated, he makes him sign leave them quiet."
19943,66,4,2,Robin: So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.
19944,66,4,2,"Marshall: Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her."
19945,66,4,2,[Flashback]
19946,66,4,2,Corner Bistro
19947,66,4,2,"Marshall and Lily are eating a burger. Lilly questions him of the glance, he shakes the head."
19948,66,4,2,Paul's place
19949,66,4,2,Marshall shakes the head.
19950,66,4,2,21
19951,66,4,2,He throws his burger to his plate.
19952,66,4,2,Veggie Heaven
19953,66,4,2,Marshall (getting up): We're going.
19954,66,4,2,[End of Flashback]
19955,66,4,2,At McLaren's
19956,66,4,2,Marshall: But none of those places even came close.
19957,66,4,2,"Ted: There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?"
19958,66,4,2,[Flashback]
19959,66,4,2,At Ted and Marshall's apartment
19960,66,4,2,Barney: Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.
19961,66,4,2,Marshall (Watching Ted): The autographed picture.
19962,66,4,2,At the gym
19963,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin (Lifting weights): Of course I remember the place. It was the best burger I ever had. I still have dreams about this burger. Beautiful, haunting dreams! I wake up at night screaming, ""Get out of my head, burger! Get out!"""
19964,66,4,2,"Marshall: That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?"
19965,66,4,2,Regis Philbin(He knocks in a bag of boxing.): No! I never wrote it down. But not a day goes by that I don't regret it. (To Marshall) Why? Why? Do you know where it is?
19966,66,4,2,Marshall: No.
19967,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin (Threatening him with his fists.): And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face!"
19968,66,4,2,"Barney: No. No, we don't know where it is."
19969,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin (Taking Barney by the collar): Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat."
19970,66,4,2,"Barney: I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!"
19971,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin (To Marshall): What about you, Lurch? (To Ted) And what about you, satchel-mouth? (Giving a card to Barney) This is my cell. You find that burger; you call me day or night."
19972,66,4,2,"Barney: OK, Regis, we will, we will."
19973,66,4,2,Regis Philbin:What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!
19974,66,4,2,Barney: All right.
19975,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin: Let's go, all of you!"
19976,66,4,2,[End of flashback]
19977,66,4,2,At McLaren's
19978,66,4,2,"Marshall: That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says ""Burger."""
19979,66,4,2,"Robin: Green door, red neon sign that says ""Burger?"""
19980,66,4,2,Marshall: Yeah.
19981,66,4,2,"Robin: I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th."
19982,66,4,2,Marshall: I knew it was on a numbered street!
19983,66,4,2,Wendy gives to Robin her burger. Robin is going to eat it.
19984,66,4,2,Robin: Finally.
19985,66,4,2,"Marshall (taking Robin's burger in his hands): No! Robin! If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight, it's gonna be the best burger in New York. We're going downtown! He throws away the burger."
19986,66,4,2,Robin: No...
19987,66,4,2,
19988,66,4,2,In a cab
19989,66,4,2,Marshall: I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger
19990,66,4,2,"Lily: Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat."
19991,66,4,2,"Barney: You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment."
19992,66,4,2,"Lily: Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame."
19993,66,4,2,"Barney: How lame is free automatic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. He laughs."
19994,66,4,2,Ted: We should probably call Regis.
19995,66,4,2,Barney: Reg... (He takes his phone.) That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text.
19996,66,4,2,"""Million Dollar: Heads or Tails"" - Studio set"
19997,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin: Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads. The one before that was tails. You polled the audience; they came out split, 50/50. No help at all there. So, for $258,000... I have to ask you, Kathy, what's it gonna be: heads...or... (His phone rings, he reads the text and starts to leave the studio.) Excuse me. Oh, boy. I've got to go. I've got to go!"
19998,66,4,2,In the streets - In front of a green door
19999,66,4,2,"Marshall: Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words."
20000,66,4,2,Robin (On nerves): I will eat your hand.
20001,66,4,2,Marshall:Let's just go inside then. Shall we?
20002,66,4,2,In the restaurant
20003,66,4,2,"The waitress gives us their burger, except to Robin."
20004,66,4,2,Marshall (to the waitress): Thank you.
20005,66,4,2,Waitress:Yours will be right out.
20006,66,4,2,"Robin: Please, go ahead, start."
20007,66,4,2,They make as if they could wait.
20008,66,4,2,Robin: Just shut up and eat.
20009,66,4,2,Barney: All right.
20010,66,4,2,Everyone starts to eat his burger.
20011,66,4,2,Ted: Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.
20012,66,4,2,Lily: I think I just had my first burg-asm.
20013,66,4,2,"Barney: I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?"
20014,66,4,2,Marshall (putting his burger in his plate): This isn't it.
20015,66,4,2,Everybody: What?
20016,66,4,2,Marshall: It's not it.
20017,66,4,2,"Ted: Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same"
20018,66,4,2,"burger you had eight years ago, only it could never live up to your ridiculously high expectations?"
20019,66,4,2,"Robin: I mean, it is just a burger."
20020,66,4,2,"Marshall: Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive ""pas de deux"". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food."
20021,66,4,2,Lily: And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.
20022,66,4,2,"Marshall: Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says ""Burger"". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this."
20023,66,4,2,He leaves the restaurant.
20024,66,4,2,Robin: I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.
20025,66,4,2,"Lily: Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job."
20026,66,4,2,Ted: Tell them about the underpants.
20027,66,4,2,Robin: What about the underpants?
20028,66,4,2,Lily: It started a couple of weeks ago.
20029,66,4,2,[Flashback]
20030,66,4,2,"Marshall is lying on the couch, watching TV."
20031,66,4,2,Marshall: Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.
20032,66,4,2,Lily comes in the apartment.
20033,66,4,2,"Lily: Hey, baby."
20034,66,4,2,Marshall: Hey!
20035,66,4,2,Lily: Did you put on pants today?
20036,66,4,2,Marshall: Nope. They laugh.
20037,66,4,2,[End of flashback]
20038,66,4,2,"Lily: It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, ""Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that."" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail."
20039,66,4,2,"Ted: Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger."
20040,66,4,2,Robin: How big is Marshall's underpants radius?
20041,66,4,2,[Flashback]
20042,66,4,2,Veggie Heaven
20043,66,4,2,Marshall: We're going.
20044,66,4,2,He gets up from table and we can see that he's wearing underpants.
20045,66,4,2,[End of flashback]
20046,66,4,2,"Ted: Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually."
20047,66,4,2,"Barney: You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. He starts singing. ""We'll be on your side when you need a friend. Through thick and thin you can always depend. On the world leaders in credit and banking. Goliath National Bank."" Member FDIC."
20048,66,4,2,Lily: We've got to find Marshall that burger.
20049,66,4,2,"Ted: Lily, I think we're all eating that burger."
20050,66,4,2,Robin: I'm not eating that burger.
20051,66,4,2,"Lily: No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it."
20052,66,4,2,The waitress arrives with Robin's burger.
20053,66,4,2,Robin: Finally.
20054,66,4,2,"Lily: Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate."
20055,66,4,2,"Waitress: Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and ""Burger"" sign."
20056,66,4,2,Ted: What? Uptown? Where?
20057,66,4,2,Waitress: 106th and Manhattan Avenue.
20058,66,4,2,"Robin takes her plate when Ted, Lily and Barney are leaving the restaurant. She's going to eat the burger when Barney makes her sign to come."
20059,66,4,2,Robin: Damn it.
20060,66,4,2,In a cab
20061,66,4,2,Marshall: 106. A numbered street. Of course.
20062,66,4,2,Barney's phone rings. He answers.
20063,66,4,2,Barney: Barney Stinson.
20064,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin (in front of the last restaurant): Barney, where the hell are you?"
20065,66,4,2,"Barney: I'm sorry, this is...?"
20066,66,4,2,Regis Philbin: Regis. I'm at the place.
20067,66,4,2,"Barney: Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now."
20068,66,4,2,"Regis Philbin: What? Uptown? He breaks a mail box. Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare."
20069,66,4,2,Barney: Onions?
20070,66,4,2,Regis Philbin (screaming): Onions?
20071,66,4,2,"Barney: Okay, no onions."
20072,66,4,2,Marshall: Stop the cab!
20073,66,4,2,They come down from the taxi and Marshall begins to look for the famous green door.
20074,66,4,2,Marshall: Wait. This is it.
20075,66,4,2,Man in the streets: Your search is over. We got girls taking off their clothes.
20076,66,4,2,Marshall: This is it.
20077,66,4,2,They discover a Goliath National Bank ATM.
20078,66,4,2,"Barney: One of 9,000 convenient locations."
20079,66,4,2,Marshall: It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.
20080,66,4,2,Robin: I don't understand. Where is the burger place?
20081,66,4,2,Ted: It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.
20082,66,4,2,Robin (getting crazy): That's fine. Let's just eat here.
20083,66,4,2,Ted: We can't eat here. It's an ATM.
20084,66,4,2,Robin: But... food.
20085,66,4,2,Lily starting to hit Barney with her fits.
20086,66,4,2,Barney: What the...
20087,66,4,2,"Lily: This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this."
20088,66,4,2,"Barney: It's not my... Stop, okay. She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily."
20089,66,4,2,"Lily: I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!"
20090,66,4,2,"Barney: Marshall, Geez."
20091,66,4,2,"Lily: They suck, suck!"
20092,66,4,2,Barney: Will you just tell her already?
20093,66,4,2,Lily: Tell me what? Tell me what?
20094,66,4,2,Marshall: I got a job.
20095,66,4,2,Lily: What? Where?
20096,66,4,2,"Marshall: Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together."
20097,66,4,2,"Barney: Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor."
20098,66,4,2,Lily: But you want to be an environmental lawyer.
20099,66,4,2,"Marshall: Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again."
20100,66,4,2,Lily: You've got great pants.
20101,66,4,2,Marshall: I love you.
20102,66,4,2,Lily: I love you.
20103,66,4,2,They hug while Robin is searching into the dustbin.
20104,66,4,2,"Ted: Robin, no!"
20105,66,4,2,Robin: They're unopened.
20106,66,4,2,Ted: Give it.
20107,66,4,2,Robin: They're barbecue.
20108,66,4,2,Ted: Give it!
20109,66,4,2,He takes her a package of chips.
20110,66,4,2,Lily: I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.
20111,66,4,2,"Marshall: It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy."
20112,66,4,2,"Man: You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks."
20113,66,4,2,Robin (Licking an envelope.): A hundred bucks? That's crazy.
20114,66,4,2,Marshall: Let's pay the man.
20115,66,4,2,Lily: I paid for the cab.
20116,66,4,2,Ted: I have any cash.
20117,66,4,2,Marshall: I haven't worked since March.
20118,66,4,2,"Barney: If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now."
20119,66,4,2,They all turn around face to the Goliath ATM.
20120,66,4,2,Barney: Member FDIC.
20121,66,4,2,"Ted from 2030: So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later..."
20122,66,4,2,Restaurant
20123,66,4,2,The man tattooed from head to foot brings to Marshall his plate.
20124,66,4,2,Marshall: Thank you.
20125,66,4,2,"Ted: All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?"
20126,66,4,2,He begins to crunch his burger slowly.
20127,66,4,2,Marshall: This is it.
20128,66,4,2,Everybody: Yes!
20129,66,4,2,"Marshall: It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up."
20130,66,4,2,Everyone starts to eat.
20131,66,4,2,"Ted from 2030: And so, after finally tasting again the burger he'd craved for so many years, Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants, and went to work, and he never looked back."
20132,66,4,2,"Lily: I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there."
20133,66,4,2,"Robin: Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me."
20134,66,4,2,Barney: This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.
20135,66,4,2,"Marshall: If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies."
20136,66,4,2,Regis Philbin: This isn't it.
20137,66,4,2,Everybody: What? Come on.
20138,66,4,2,Regis gets up.
20139,66,4,2,Barney: That's outrageous.
20140,66,4,2,Regis: That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it!
20141,66,4,2,Marshall: You were just freakin' teasing us.
20142,67,4,3,"Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin are in McClaren's."
20143,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem."
20144,67,4,3,Barney comes dressed in a odd.
20145,67,4,3,"Barney: Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick."
20146,67,4,3,"Ted: Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?"
20147,67,4,3,"Barney: Hi, Ted."
20148,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): I lived in New York, but Stella was living across the river in New Jersey..."
20149,67,4,3,"Ted comes home and finds Stella on the couch, asleep, in undress."
20150,67,4,3,"Ted: Oh, no!"
20151,67,4,3,Ted (2030):... So I took the train all the time.
20152,67,4,3,"Man: What's up, Ted?"
20153,67,4,3,"Ted: Hi, Matisse."
20154,67,4,3,Ted arrives at the bar.
20155,67,4,3,Marshall: Theodore!
20156,67,4,3,Barney: T-Diddy! You've missed that!
20157,67,4,3,Lily: Robin has had the job of presenter.
20158,67,4,3,Robin: And we have a free bottle of champagne.
20159,67,4,3,Marshall: But it's empty now.
20160,67,4,3,"Ted: Oh, no!"
20161,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): So, it was always as if I missed any."
20162,67,4,3,Ted comes back with Stella where she is at table with her daughter.
20163,67,4,3,"Stella: Sorry, we could not wait. It cooled."
20164,67,4,3,"Ted: Oh, no!"
20165,67,4,3,"Lucy: Hey, big."
20166,67,4,3,"Ted: What's up, G?"
20167,67,4,3,Stella: Are you okay?
20168,67,4,3,"Ted: Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train."
20169,67,4,3,"Stella: Exactly, why not you invited your friends to come here?"
20170,67,4,3,Ted: It's a great idea.
20171,67,4,3,"Marshall, Lily, Barney and Ted are in the bar."
20172,67,4,3,"Marshall: You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great."
20173,67,4,3,Ted: Why?
20174,67,4,3,"Barney: First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago."
20175,67,4,3,Ted: Lily?
20176,67,4,3,"Lily: I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone."
20177,67,4,3,Ted: What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?
20178,67,4,3,Flashback
20179,67,4,3,Ted returned to the apartment.
20180,67,4,3,"Ted: And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey."
20181,67,4,3,Then he arrives at the bar with a T-shirt indicating he did not like New Jersey.
20182,67,4,3,"Ted: Great, huh?"
20183,67,4,3,Marshall and Lily out of the apartment.
20184,67,4,3,Marshall: It's waiting for you?
20185,67,4,3,"Ted: No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey."
20186,67,4,3,End flashback
20187,67,4,3,"Ted: So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body."
20188,67,4,3,"Lily: Ted, if you murdered me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever."
20189,67,4,3,Ted: And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?
20190,67,4,3,Lily: I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons.
20191,67,4,3,GENERIC
20192,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): Children, your Aunt Robin was tired of his job, tired of lousy production..."
20193,67,4,3,"Robin: I am Robin Scherbatsky, and you look... (The Metro M falls) Etro New One to 23h. (Thus the one from 11 pm) And again at 1am."
20194,67,4,3,Ted (2030):... tired of the stories she had to announce.
20195,67,4,3,Robin: So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York.
20196,67,4,3,"Ted (2030):... and most of all, fed up with stupid puns."
20197,67,4,3,"Robin: Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died."
20198,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): So, when she knew she was national presenter, she could finally say the words she longed to say for years."
20199,67,4,3,"Lily, Marshall, Barney and Ted Metro New One look at the bar."
20200,67,4,3,"Robin: Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious."
20201,67,4,3,Marshall: Why it looks silly? She had a stroke?
20202,67,4,3,"Ted: Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good."
20203,67,4,3,"Robin: With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all."
20204,67,4,3,"Lily: It's you who wrote, right?"
20205,67,4,3,Ted: This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.
20206,67,4,3,Marshall: You wore towels.
20207,67,4,3,Ted: It's part of the team.
20208,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): This Saturday, when Robin left for his first day, we crossed the river to experience the amazing nightlife of New Jersey."
20209,67,4,3,The band is at Stella except Robin.
20210,67,4,3,"Ted: Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome."
20211,67,4,3,"Stella: Well, there are games, there are movies. And there shall be beer in the garage."
20212,67,4,3,Stella goes out to the garage.
20213,67,4,3,"Marshall: It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact."
20214,67,4,3,"Barney: Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian."
20215,67,4,3,Marshall: No snakes on that plane.
20216,67,4,3,"Ted: Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?"
20217,67,4,3,"Lily: With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h."
20218,67,4,3,Barney: You can be at 22h.
20219,67,4,3,"Lily: No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey."
20220,67,4,3,Stella came back with beers in their hands.
20221,67,4,3,Stella: You really hate this part.
20222,67,4,3,Marshall: What? No!
20223,67,4,3,"Stella: No, I understand, you're New Yorkers, you need a bar.You could go to the coolest bar in the state, which is so close that you will not believe it. (They descend the basement) and bang, here. The coolest bar in New Jersey."
20224,67,4,3,"Lily: Yeah, probably."
20225,67,4,3,Ted: That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.
20226,67,4,3,Barney: No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!
20227,67,4,3,Ted: For torturlute? You're right.
20228,67,4,3,Barney: Marshall.
20229,67,4,3,Marshall: You deserve better than that.
20230,67,4,3,Barney: Lily.
20231,67,4,3,Lily: Not good enough.
20232,67,4,3,Barney: Stella.
20233,67,4,3,Stella: Sorry.
20234,67,4,3,"Barney: I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not."
20235,67,4,3,Stella: Who wants to play Scrabble?
20236,67,4,3,"Lily: Yes, why not."
20237,67,4,3,"Stella: Look, the letter ""X"" is a bit difficult to read because a few years ago, she walked into my dog. You know, we should get a dog when you come to live here."
20238,67,4,3,Ted: When I what?
20239,67,4,3,Stella: Super. This is Robin.
20240,67,4,3,She gets up and goes back to go open the door.
20241,67,4,3,Lily: I thought they came to live with you.
20242,67,4,3,"Ted: Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?"
20243,67,4,3,"Barney: Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!"
20244,67,4,3,Ted: I can not live here.
20245,67,4,3,"Marshall: It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey."
20246,67,4,3,Barney: Air Hockey. Well done my fat.
20247,67,4,3,"Ted: I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months."
20248,67,4,3,Flashback
20249,67,4,3,Ted and Stella have a drink at the apartment.
20250,67,4,3,"Ted: I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here."
20251,67,4,3,"Stella: Yeah, it could play in the fire escape, be friend with the guy who sleeps on a couch in the driveway, biking on Broadway. Great idea, Ted."
20252,67,4,3,End flashback
20253,67,4,3,Ted: I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.
20254,67,4,3,"Barney: Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle."
20255,67,4,3,Robin: Stella has already warned me.
20256,67,4,3,"Marshall: So, your first day?"
20257,67,4,3,Robin: It was not.
20258,67,4,3,All: What?
20259,67,4,3,"Robin: It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview."
20260,67,4,3,Barney: How so?
20261,67,4,3,Robin: I know. He told me that I had had it.
20262,67,4,3,Flashback
20263,67,4,3,"Robin is in the toilet of the bar, on the phone."
20264,67,4,3,Robin: I got it? I got it!
20265,67,4,3,Robin puts his phone and dance.
20266,67,4,3,"Voice: Let's be clear, when I say ""you"", I mean the interview.You have the interview. I do not want there to be confusion.You only maintenance. Not the job."
20267,67,4,3,She takes her phone.
20268,67,4,3,Robin: Thank you! Thank you!
20269,67,4,3,End flashback
20270,67,4,3,Robin: I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job.
20271,67,4,3,Marshall: No!
20272,67,4,3,Lily: You hate that job.
20273,67,4,3,Robin: It was not so bad.
20274,67,4,3,Lily: How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain?
20275,67,4,3,Robin: A cycorde.
20276,67,4,3,Marshall: You're in the eye of cycorde.
20277,67,4,3,Ted: Thank you.
20278,67,4,3,Barney: Naughty.
20279,67,4,3,"Robin: That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?"
20280,67,4,3,Barney: You can not.
20281,67,4,3,"Lily: You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts."
20282,67,4,3,Robin: I called Joel.
20283,67,4,3,"Barney: If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video,  m http://www.. m ."
20284,67,4,3,Robin: Come on. I will not call.
20285,67,4,3,"Stella (descending): not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time."
20286,67,4,3,Barney: This is the look.
20287,67,4,3,
20288,67,4,3,Ted and Marshall are at the supermarket.
20289,67,4,3,Ted: I can not live here. I hate being here. I would kill myself.
20290,67,4,3,"Marshall: New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup."
20291,67,4,3,"Ted: It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you."
20292,67,4,3,Stella...
20293,67,4,3,Barney: I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200.
20294,67,4,3,"Lily: Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer."
20295,67,4,3,Barney: $ 10 000.
20296,67,4,3,At the supermarket...
20297,67,4,3,Marshall: You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time.
20298,67,4,3,Ted: I'm sorry. You are in New York?
20299,67,4,3,Woman: We lived in Manhattan.
20300,67,4,3,Ted: Are you in town?
20301,67,4,3,Woman: All the time.
20302,67,4,3,Marshall: You see? All the time.
20303,67,4,3,Ted: When was the last time?
20304,67,4,3,Man: We dined with O'Rourke.
20305,67,4,3,Ted: It's been closed for six years.
20306,67,4,3,"Woman: It's been a while. Funny, not that we lack."
20307,67,4,3,"Man: I guess is the New Jersey-vegans, now. Honey, look, T-shirt with dogs."
20308,67,4,3,Ted: I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.
20309,67,4,3,"Marshall: What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier?"
20310,67,4,3,Stella...
20311,67,4,3,Lily: It's the tears?
20312,67,4,3,Barney: They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional.
20313,67,4,3,Lily: Where is Robin?
20314,67,4,3,They date back to the lounge where Robin phone.
20315,67,4,3,"Robin: Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel."
20316,67,4,3,"Barney: Robin, hangs up. Do not do that."
20317,67,4,3,"Robin: Sorry, I know, OK?"
20318,67,4,3,Lily: If you hang up no...
20319,67,4,3,"Robin: Stop! Joel, this is Robin."
20320,67,4,3,"Joel: So, Ms. Papillon wants to return to his cocoon."
20321,67,4,3,Robin: I'm sorry for saying all this stuff.
20322,67,4,3,"Joel: You can put your socks with your apology, for you have already been replaced. Brian is the makeup and it could not be more excited."
20323,67,4,3,Biran: I can not do that. I can not do that.
20324,67,4,3,"Joel: Look, although I want to see what college is over for the camera, if you can be here for the 23h, you can get your job."
20325,67,4,3,Robin hangs up.
20326,67,4,3,"Robin: Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio."
20327,67,4,3,Lily: You can never be in town in 30 minutes.
20328,67,4,3,"Barney: Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it."
20329,67,4,3,Robin: I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h.
20330,67,4,3,She leaves home and takes Stella the bike that is on the porch. It is 10:31 p.m.. Marshall and Ted back.
20331,67,4,3,Stella: You got the beer?
20332,67,4,3,"Ted: Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk."
20333,67,4,3,Stella: And you registered?
20334,67,4,3,Ted: No.
20335,67,4,3,Stella: Why?
20336,67,4,3,"Ted: Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey."
20337,67,4,3,Stella: What?
20338,67,4,3,Ted: I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.
20339,67,4,3,"Stella: My daughter goes to school here. All his friends are here. I have lived here all my life. My whole family is here. This is my house. I'm at the EPA. And since June 1, I am the deputy mayor."
20340,67,4,3,"Ted: Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro."
20341,67,4,3,"Stella: It moves not, end of discussion."
20342,67,4,3,"Ted: How does it ""end of discussion""? It never was."
20343,67,4,3,Stella: That's what being a parent. I want to uproot Lucy.
20344,67,4,3,Ted: People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.
20345,67,4,3,Stella: It is. New York is the largest city in the world. Where the dream come true and of pigeon sh1t tastes like tapioca. Want a little secret? New Jersey... is better than New York.
20346,67,4,3,Ted: Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.
20347,67,4,3,"Stella: New York is full of crazies, snobs and bad people. You know that once an old woman called me a slut and gave me a cat in his face? And you want to know if it's the same in New Jersey? 86th and Lex, right in front of your dear little Papaya King. The people of New Jersey are nice. This is the kind of place where you know your neighbors."
20348,67,4,3,"Ted: Hey, I know my neighbors!"
20349,67,4,3,"Stella: Yes, that kind?"
20350,67,4,3,"Ted: At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I."
20351,67,4,3,Stella: Claxpamon?
20352,67,4,3,Lily: It is called Paxton.
20353,67,4,3,Ted: I love this guy.
20354,67,4,3,"10:47 p.m., Robin is the bike on the train."
20355,67,4,3,"Robin: Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first."
20356,67,4,3,Matisse: Do not spill Matisse.
20357,67,4,3,Basement of Stella...
20358,67,4,3,"Lily: Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more."
20359,67,4,3,"Barney: Oh, yes. Tape for safety."
20360,67,4,3,Stella: It was Atlantic City.
20361,67,4,3,Barney: You can not beat A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know.
20362,67,4,3,Ted: New York has Greenwich Village.
20363,67,4,3,Stella: New Jersey coast.
20364,67,4,3,Barney: Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!
20365,67,4,3,Stella: Bruce Springsteen.
20366,67,4,3,Ted: Sinatra.
20367,67,4,3,Stella: It's in Hoboken... New Jersey.
20368,67,4,3,"Ted: But that city he sings? This is not ""Secaucus, Secaucus."""
20369,67,4,3,"10:56 p.m., Robin slalom between the cars."
20370,67,4,3,"Ted (2030): Children, believe it or not, but Aunt Robin swears it happened like this..."
20371,67,4,3,Robin takes flight and goes over the cars creating a traffic jam.
20372,67,4,3,Stella...
20373,67,4,3,"Lily: Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey, you think not to like New York, but believe me, Marshall did not believe it either, and now he would move for anything."
20374,67,4,3,"Marshall: I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas."
20375,67,4,3,"Lily: but, Marshall, you love New York."
20376,67,4,3,"Marshall: Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?"
20377,67,4,3,"Barney: Small town, big men, then tope."
20378,67,4,3,"Marshall: It is too noisy, all the time. Yes, it is the city that never sleeps. Well, I would sleep well. I'm tired for 8 years. Tired and scared, with black and blue marks on my elbows to try to keep between the gateway for elves. New Jersey's great. There are department stores, and lawn and you do not have to wear a cup. For the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say so. I love New Jersey. Just kidding."
20379,67,4,3,"Ted: I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn."
20380,67,4,3,"Stella: You know what, Ted... Live wherever you want. I do not care."
20381,67,4,3,Stella back.
20382,67,4,3,Barney: Silence embarrassed. Tope then.
20383,67,4,3,Ted goes upstairs to see Stella.
20384,67,4,3,"Ted: Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?"
20385,67,4,3,Lucy: There was noise in the cellar.
20386,67,4,3,Ted: Sorry. Go back to sleep.
20387,67,4,3,Lucy: I can not sleep without a story.
20388,67,4,3,"Ted: Ok, I'll get your mom..."
20389,67,4,3,Lucy: Why do you not read me one?
20390,67,4,3,Ted: Let's go.
20391,67,4,3,Ted reads a story to Lucy while Stella is sitting on the stairs.Lucy falls asleep and Ted goes down to the lounge where he hugged from behind Stella.
20392,67,4,3,Ted: I moved here.
20393,67,4,3,Stella: Really?
20394,67,4,3,Ted: Really. New Jersey wins.
20395,67,4,3,"10:59 p.m., Robin arrives at the studio of Metro New One."
20396,67,4,3,"Robin: Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York."
20397,67,4,3,"Barney: Look, it did."
20398,67,4,3,"Robin: Our story tonight, the baby panda at the zoo in Central Park made his first tooth today. I think that makes him a... Bear molar. Bear molar. Bear molar. You know what? It's really over for me. Good night, New York."
20399,67,4,3,Lily: It really stops.
20400,67,4,3,Barney: You think you're there for something?
20401,67,4,3,"Lily: I think so. Good job, Barney."
20402,67,4,3,"Barney: Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I killed my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!"
20403,67,4,3,"Stella, Ted, Barney, Lily and Marshall are at the bar and joined Robin. Barney again the bars in the air."
20404,67,4,3,Lily: What's the matter?
20405,67,4,3,Robin: I have not officially got the job.
20406,67,4,3,Lily: I'm sorry.
20407,67,4,3,Robin: It's OK. They offer me another.
20408,67,4,3,Ted: It's great. This is for what?
20409,67,4,3,Robin: Foreign Correspondent. I... moved to Japan.
20410,67,4,3,Barney lowers his arm.
20411,68,4,4,"Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin are in McClaren's."
20412,68,4,4,Robin: Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work.
20413,68,4,4,Marshall: I think it'll work.
20414,68,4,4,Lily: I hope not.
20415,68,4,4,Ted: There he is.
20416,68,4,4,"Barney arrives at the bar, disguised as a senior."
20417,68,4,4,"Barney (old): You there, what's your name?"
20418,68,4,4,Woman: Excuse me?
20419,68,4,4,"Barney (old): Your name, woman, what's your name?"
20420,68,4,4,Wife Cindy.
20421,68,4,4,"Barney (old): I knew it. You are ""the"" Cindy, one that can change everything and bring us to our downfall. Listen to me, Cindy. I am Barney Stinson, and I have an urgent mission from the future."
20422,68,4,4,Cindy: From the future?
20423,68,4,4,"Barney (old): The future, and I can prove it to you. In exactly four seconds, the woman at this table will slap this man."
20424,68,4,4,Robin slaps Ted.
20425,68,4,4,Ted: What are you doing?
20426,68,4,4,"Barney: In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight."
20427,68,4,4,Cindy: What? I...
20428,68,4,4,"Barney (old) to bed with Barney Stinson tonight, do whatever he wants, or he will find no solution to global warming that would save the human race."
20429,68,4,4,Cindy: You mean what?
20430,68,4,4,"Barney (old): I have not the time to explain. I must return to reality accelerator before the vortex closes. Only you can save us, Cindy. I must go!"
20431,68,4,4,Barney leaves the bar.
20432,68,4,4,"Lily: Well, the movers arrive in 14 hours. We have to go back to finish the boxes."
20433,68,4,4,Robin: You have not finished? Why is it so long?
20434,68,4,4,Ted: The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past.
20435,68,4,4,Robin: Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour.
20436,68,4,4,Lily: A half hour?
20437,68,4,4,"Robin: I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears."
20438,68,4,4,Marshall: Moving is very moving.
20439,68,4,4,"Ted: But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual sh1t. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive."
20440,68,4,4,"Wendy: This is a Glen McKenna 50 years, and it is $ 2 500."
20441,68,4,4,"Ted: Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?"
20442,68,4,4,Barney enters the bar.
20443,68,4,4,Barney: Vive la vodka.
20444,68,4,4,Robin: It will not work.
20445,68,4,4,"Cindy: My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?"
20446,68,4,4,"Barney: I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on."
20447,68,4,4,Cindy: Global warming?
20448,68,4,4,Barney: My God! How do you know that?
20449,68,4,4,GENERIC
20450,68,4,4,"Marshall, Lily, Robin and Ted are the cartoons."
20451,68,4,4,Ted: Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories.
20452,68,4,4,"Robin: Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away."
20453,68,4,4,Ted: So you keep a photograph?
20454,68,4,4,"Robin: It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess."
20455,68,4,4,Ted: Why not?
20456,68,4,4,"Lily: Oh, dear. That's what the guys know that after moving in with a woman. All your stuff are idiots."
20457,68,4,4,Ted: Like what?
20458,68,4,4,Lily: Like everything else you bought the medieval festivals.
20459,68,4,4,Ted: There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge.
20460,68,4,4,"Marshall: As you will not get bail, I thought you could pay me half."
20461,68,4,4,"Ted: Wait, why I pay more?"
20462,68,4,4,Marshall: Because you've treated this apart as John Bonham treated his nervous system.
20463,68,4,4,Ted: That's not true.
20464,68,4,4,Marshall: Proof A.
20465,68,4,4,He draws a card and reveals a wall damaged.

20467,68,4,4,Marshall entered the apartment. Ted puts his books on shelves.
20468,68,4,4,Marshall: What is it?
20469,68,4,4,"Ted: An Encyclopedia ""World Book"" of 1986. It is with these that I grew up."
20470,68,4,4,Marshall: Encyclopedia?
20471,68,4,4,"Ted: Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the ""e"". The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change..."
20472,68,4,4,The shelves and take away the plaster fall with them.
20473,68,4,4,"Marshall: You know, it'll have you ""dia-pays"" for it."

20475,68,4,4,"Marshall: But you've ever done. Second, the evidence B."

20477,68,4,4,"Ted entered the apartment, disguised."
20478,68,4,4,"Ted: Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival."
20479,68,4,4,He turned his scourge and pat on the ceiling.
20480,68,4,4,End flashback
20481,68,4,4,Marshall: You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend.
20482,68,4,4,Robin: What damage did I do?
20483,68,4,4,Marshall: Do you remember the time you got drunk the pack of beer and you've become Super Canadian?

20485,68,4,4,Robin plays hockey in the apartment.
20486,68,4,4,Robin: Stanley Cup game six? The Rangers will regret having met with the Canucks.
20487,68,4,4,Marshall: $ 20 if you manage to run it through the door.
20488,68,4,4,Robin: You're more amazing than a Tim Hortons donut. Timmy Ho!
20489,68,4,4,It takes Lily and the intercepts.
20490,68,4,4,Lily is Enough. Give me the stick.
20491,68,4,4,"Robin: I'll give you the teeth of happiness. A little here, a little there."
20492,68,4,4,Lily: Give me the stick.
20493,68,4,4,"Robin: Get out, bouseuse."
20494,68,4,4,Lily: Let's go!
20495,68,4,4,Lily throws herself on her to catch the crook.
20496,68,4,4,"Ted: Catch it, guys!"
20497,68,4,4,Robin: I'll break!
20498,68,4,4,They fight.
20499,68,4,4,"Ted: Girls, stop!"
20500,68,4,4,Marshall: For America.
20501,68,4,4,Ted: It's good enough!
20502,68,4,4,Barney: It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!
20503,68,4,4,"He gives a fist into the wall, and made a hole."
20504,68,4,4,End flashback
20505,68,4,4,"Ted: Barney's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter."
20506,68,4,4,Flashback
20507,68,4,4,Lots of people are in an apartment.
20508,68,4,4,"Ted (2030): Children, to understand the history of the burn, I must tell you the story of the intervention for our friend, Stewart."
20509,68,4,4,Stewart: What's going on?
20510,68,4,4,Man: This is an intervention.
20511,68,4,4,"Women: Alcohol has changed you, Stewart. We recognize you more. And I love the man I married."
20512,68,4,4,Stewart: Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all.
20513,68,4,4,Barney reaches a bottle in his hand.
20514,68,4,4,Barney: This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!
20515,68,4,4,Stewart: No.
20516,68,4,4,"Barney: Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?"
20517,68,4,4,(Robin whispers in his ear) That's the invitation to have flown.
20518,68,4,4,"Ted (2030): This evening, we celebrated our first successful intervention."
20519,68,4,4,At the apartment...
20520,68,4,4,Robin: I'm really proud that we have helped Stewart.
20521,68,4,4,"Lily: Yes, what a moment of incredible human sincerity."
20522,68,4,4,Marshall: It's true. We live.
20523,68,4,4,Barney: You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?
20524,68,4,4,"Lily: Yes, it's been two weeks."
20525,68,4,4,"Marshall: Two wonderful weeks... and oh yes, I will continue to wear it."
20526,68,4,4,He left the apartment with the hat on. The next day...
20527,68,4,4,Lily: This is an intervention.
20528,68,4,4,Ted: About the hat.
20529,68,4,4,Marshall: I control. I can remove it whenever I want.
20530,68,4,4,"Robin: ""Dear Marshall, I do not like that stupid hat. I want to cut with a scythe. Or, cut the chisel, for you looks like a real jerk. """
20531,68,4,4,"Ted (2030): After that, the interventions have become frequent in the apartment."
20532,68,4,4,Lily returns.
20533,68,4,4,Lily: Oh my God. This is one of p'tain of pleasant surprise. This is about what?
20534,68,4,4,Ted: This is about the exaggerated English accent.
20535,68,4,4,Lily: P'tain.
20536,68,4,4,It's time for Robin.
20537,68,4,4,"Robin: Self Tanner? They entice you with a coupon, and after it becomes addictive."
20538,68,4,4,"Lily: We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest."
20539,68,4,4,Then Barney.
20540,68,4,4,Barney: What?
20541,68,4,4,Robin: The magic tricks.
20542,68,4,4,"Lily: Specifically, those with fire."
20543,68,4,4,"Barney: The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage! (There is a magic trick, but set fire to the banner) Thanks! Oh, sh1t."
20544,68,4,4,Lily: It smells like hair!
20545,68,4,4,Ted (2030): And here the history of the burn.
20546,68,4,4,End flashback
20547,68,4,4,"Ted: It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner."
20548,68,4,4,Marshall: And?
20549,68,4,4,"Ted: And the flag was burned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with ""Ted"" written on it. You prepare a response for me?"
20550,68,4,4,"Lily: Well, that was stupid. Yes, forget it."
20551,68,4,4,Ted: That was why? The sandals? Hair products?
20552,68,4,4,Marshall: No Stella.
20553,68,4,4,"Ted: My God, it was for Stella."
20554,68,4,4,"Marshall: I just said ""No Stella."" It was perhaps for your hearing problems."
20555,68,4,4,Ted: What?
20556,68,4,4,Marshall: It's getting serious. You see?
20557,68,4,4,Ted: You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry.
20558,68,4,4,Marshall: We want him. We are all really happy for you.
20559,68,4,4,"Lily: Like I said, it was stupid."
20560,68,4,4,"Ted: Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions."
20561,68,4,4,Flashback
20562,68,4,4,They are all in the apartment.
20563,68,4,4,Ted: We made too many interventions.
20564,68,4,4,End flashback
20565,68,4,4,Ted: What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?
20566,68,4,4,"Barney (incoming): Yes! In the mouth! You said that the ""Barney the future"" work out. You told me I was crazy. My shrink told me I was crazy. Which is the narcissist with severe emotional disorders, Dr. Grossbard? A banner of intervention?That's what?"
20567,68,4,4,Ted: Stella.
20568,68,4,4,"Barney: ""I can not remain indifferent... """
20569,68,4,4,Ted: You kept it on you?
20570,68,4,4,"Barney: Please. ""I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... ""Flames! Oh, sh1t! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, ""glass half full"", but I think they become beasts."
20571,68,4,4,"Marshall: Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80."
20572,68,4,4,Barney: I meet this challenge.
20573,68,4,4,Marshall: What challenge?
20574,68,4,4,Barney: Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.
20575,68,4,4,"Marshall: I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged."
20576,68,4,4,Barney part.
20577,68,4,4,Ted: I want to hear the other letters.
20578,68,4,4,Lily: This is ridiculous. It changed his mind.
20579,68,4,4,"Ted: And if you changed yet? Go Lily, listen to yours."
20580,68,4,4,"Lily: ""The capabilities of Gilbert reading have improved considerably... ""This is a letter I had to give one of my students."
20581,68,4,4,
20582,68,4,4,A mother is in her son's room.
20583,68,4,4,Woman: Things go too fast between you and a girl named Stella?
20584,68,4,4,Boy: I'd like.
20585,68,4,4,Ted: I can hear yours?
20586,68,4,4,"Robin: ""Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin. """
20587,68,4,4,Ted: You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?
20588,68,4,4,"Robin: I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?"
20589,68,4,4,Marshall: Water has flowed under the bridge...
20590,68,4,4,Ted: Come on.
20591,68,4,4,"Marshall: ""Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer. "" It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement."
20592,68,4,4,Ted: Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.
20593,68,4,4,Marshall: And we're here.
20594,68,4,4,Robin: And we hope you're not sorry.
20595,68,4,4,Ted: Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.
20596,68,4,4,Lily: But concerns that a completely expelled.
20597,68,4,4,Ted: But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.
20598,68,4,4,"Marshall: You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know."
20599,68,4,4,"Ted: I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?"
20600,68,4,4,Marshall: Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low.
20601,68,4,4,"Ted: My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?"
20602,68,4,4,Lily: It was sophisticated.
20603,68,4,4,Ted: My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!
20604,68,4,4,Robin: What are you doing?
20605,68,4,4,Ted: I unpack. I never leave this apartment.
20606,68,4,4,"Lily: Ted, stop unpacking. You're in the process of pinball."
20607,68,4,4,"Ted: I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!"
20608,68,4,4,"Barney at the bar, again disguised as a senior."
20609,68,4,4,"Barney (old): Good evening, young lady. You want a caramel?What do you mean, ""nothing in common""? We're both older."
20610,68,4,4,Woman: You're cute. How old are you?
20611,68,4,4,Barney: 83 years. How old are you?
20612,68,4,4,Female: 31 years.
20613,68,4,4,At the apartment...
20614,68,4,4,Lily: Ted going bonkers. The movers arrive in 10 hours. His bride awaits in New Jersey. We must do something.
20615,68,4,4,"Marshall: I'm on it. Hey, man?"
20616,68,4,4,Ted: Hey.
20617,68,4,4,Marshall: Come here a minute.
20618,68,4,4,Ted: What?
20619,68,4,4,"Marshall: Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the knife? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!"
20620,68,4,4,"Robin: Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. ""Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler. """
20621,68,4,4,Marshall: I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.
20622,68,4,4,"Robin: You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily."
20623,68,4,4,"Lily: This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either."
20624,68,4,4,Robin: Come on.
20625,68,4,4,"Lily: Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump."
20626,68,4,4,"Robin: My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you."
20627,68,4,4,"Lily: Oh, honey."
20628,68,4,4,"Marshall: Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good?"
20629,68,4,4,"Ted: Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!"
20630,68,4,4,They arrive at the bar and discovers Barney (old) kissing a woman.
20631,68,4,4,"Ted: Oh, my God!"
20632,68,4,4,Barney: I think someone owes me $ 200.
20633,68,4,4,"Marshall: Barney, it was not a gamble. Person..."
20634,68,4,4,Barney (old): This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis.
20635,68,4,4,Ted: I am moving to New Jersey.
20636,68,4,4,Lily: What?
20637,68,4,4,"Ted: And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan."
20638,68,4,4,Robin: Why?
20639,68,4,4,"Ted: Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?"
20640,68,4,4,"Barney (old): You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years."
20641,68,4,4,"Woman: Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World War II."
20642,68,4,4,Barney (old): In an instant my child.
20643,68,4,4,"Marshall: Okay, it matters not."
20644,68,4,4,Barney (old): What? Why?
20645,68,4,4,"Robin: It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net."
20646,68,4,4,"Ted: You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one."
20647,68,4,4,Woman: I had to leave my laptop...
20648,68,4,4,Ted: Remove from here.
20649,68,4,4,In 2009...
20650,68,4,4,"Ted (2030): And a year later, that's exactly what we did."
20651,68,4,4,"Ted: So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell."
20652,68,4,4,Robin: Amazing.
20653,68,4,4,Barney: It's amazing.
20654,68,4,4,"Ted: It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?"
20655,68,4,4,Marshall: Not at all.
20656,68,4,4,Barney: I would much Red Bull.
20657,68,4,4,"Robin: Wendy, you can take a picture?"
20658,68,4,4,"Ted (2030): Many things we changed this year, but some have remained the same."
20659,68,4,4,Lily: So if we continued the evening up there?
20660,68,4,4,Marshall: Yeah.
20661,68,4,4,Ted: Good idea. I have the tape.
20662,68,4,4,"Barney enters the apartment, disguised as old."
20663,68,4,4,Barney (old): What...?
20664,68,4,4,Robin: Barney is an intervention.
20665,68,4,4,"Barney (old): Sorry, I hear you."
20666,68,4,4,"Marshall: That's enough, the trick of ""old."""
20667,68,4,4,Barney (old): The trick in the middle?
20668,68,4,4,Lily: Forget it.
20669,68,4,4,Barney (old): Leave baby? I love this old rhyme!
20670,68,4,4,Ted: I will get my problem.
20671,68,4,4,Barney: You're going to get my boat?
20672,69,4,5,Ted and Stella joined the others at McClaren's.
20673,69,4,5,Ted: Hi.
20674,69,4,5,Lily: Hi. How are you?
20675,69,4,5,Stella (taking the glass of Barney): I'll just finish this.
20676,69,4,5,Ted: It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.
20677,69,4,5,"Stella: You know, you dream of the perfect wedding since you been little girl."
20678,69,4,5,Lily: Yeah.
20679,69,4,5,Marshall: Bluntly.

20685,69,4,5,Ted: It seems that the lamb is great here.
20686,69,4,5,"Nora: I'm vegan. I wish I could silence that voice in me that says eating animals is murder, but I guess I'm not as strong as you."

20692,69,4,5,Stella is the restaurant with his sister and Ted.
20693,69,4,5,"Nora: I hate it! I hate him. God, this steak is good. 4 days before and he fled with a consultant from Whole Foods? I do my make-up more for him. I do not shower more for him. I shave armpits more for him."

20695,69,4,5,"Nora: Now, so close to the wedding... Got some bacon or something in the sauce. I love it. I would not be refunded. I will lose thousands of dollars."
20696,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): Children in a relationship, you develop as a telepathy with your partner."

20703,69,4,5,Ted: I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous. (He throws a glass of water on his face) I would not have done that.
20704,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): Children, morality often happens at the end of the story, but this one is too important, I will say now: Never, never, invite ex to your wedding. If I was given this advice, it would have changed everything."

20732,69,4,5,"Barney: Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw."
20733,69,4,5,Stella and Ted are on a boat.
20734,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): And the day before the wedding, Stella and I made the trip to Shelter Island. With others not far away."
20735,69,4,5,"Marshall, Lily and Barney are also on board."
20736,69,4,5,"Marshall, Lily and Barney are in a bar."
20737,69,4,5,Lily: It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted.
20738,69,4,5,"Barney: ""The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation."""
20739,69,4,5,"Marshall: I know about you, but I will not namaster here too long."
20740,69,4,5,"Lily: Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink."
20741,69,4,5,Barney: You have anything like Scotch?
20742,69,4,5,"Bartender: In the center, we have a strict anti-alcohol."
20743,69,4,5,"Marshall: Super, meals included, right?"
20744,69,4,5,"Woman: Yes, and they are all 100% vegan."
20745,69,4,5,"Barney: I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?"
20746,69,4,5,Marshall: There's no meat.
20747,69,4,5,Lily: There's no alcohol.
20748,69,4,5,"Marshall: Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors."
20749,69,4,5,Ted joined them.
20750,69,4,5,"Ted: Guys, Stella and I have a little problem."
20751,69,4,5,Flashback
20752,69,4,5,"Stella is sitting on the bed and watch the programs, while Ted packs his things."
20753,69,4,5,"Stella: The programs are great. It is not our names on it, but otherwise it looks nice."
20754,69,4,5,"Ted: Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time."
20755,69,4,5,Stella: You're invited Robin?
20756,69,4,5,"Ted: Yes, of course."
20757,69,4,5,Stella: You gave me no warning. I'm not sure what to think.
20758,69,4,5,Ted: Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.
20759,69,4,5,"Stella: Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird."
20760,69,4,5,Ted: But no.
20761,69,4,5,Stella: It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage.
20762,69,4,5,Stella imagine the scene.
20763,69,4,5,Robin: Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.
20764,69,4,5,"Stella: When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back?"
20765,69,4,5,"Ted: Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old."
20766,69,4,5,Stella: Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?
20767,69,4,5,Ted: She already has his ticket.
20768,69,4,5,Stella: It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.
20769,69,4,5,Ted: It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.
20770,69,4,5,"Stella: No, Tony is the last person I want to see here, OK? And Robin is the penultimate."
20771,69,4,5,Flashback
20772,69,4,5,"Ted: Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that."
20773,69,4,5,"Robin has the information, while a monkey sits next to her and slap on the desktop."
20774,69,4,5,"Robin: Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year."
20775,69,4,5,Back to the place of marriage of Ted and Stella.
20776,69,4,5,Ted: What should I do?
20777,69,4,5,"Marshall: I know. I understand something is ""no ex"". Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone."
20778,69,4,5,Barney: What? No. Robin must come.
20779,69,4,5,"Ted: That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl."
20780,69,4,5,"Lily: I do not care, why do such."
20781,69,4,5,"Barney: Dude, Robin has to be there."
20782,69,4,5,Marshall: It should not come.
20783,69,4,5,Barney: What are you parl...
20784,69,4,5,"Ted: Aldrin Justice, the last word."
20785,69,4,5,"Lily: OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride."
20786,69,4,5,Ted: I will not tell him to come.
20787,69,4,5,Marshall: It's the right decision.
20788,69,4,5,Ted: It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.
20789,69,4,5,"Barney: Co-witness, I'll handle this."
20790,69,4,5,Robin picks up the telephone.
20791,69,4,5,Robin: Hello?
20792,69,4,5,"Barney: Robin, where are you?"
20793,69,4,5,Robin: I'm off to the airport.
20794,69,4,5,"Barney: OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone."
20795,69,4,5,"Ted: OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with."
20796,69,4,5,Lily: You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.
20797,69,4,5,"Ted: What do you mean by ""delicate""?"
20798,69,4,5,"Lily: The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control."
20799,69,4,5,Marshall: Do not you remember?
20800,69,4,5,Flashback
20801,69,4,5,"In 2006, Lily arrives at the apartment in tears."
20802,69,4,5,Lily: The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?
20803,69,4,5,End flashback
20804,69,4,5,"Marshall: After a while, is that the waffle."
20805,69,4,5,Lily: Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.
20806,69,4,5,Ted: What do I do?
20807,69,4,5,"Lily: You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes."
20808,69,4,5,Ted: And if there is no other crises?
20809,69,4,5,Lily: This is a bride. There will be another crisis.
20810,69,4,5,Four minutes later...
20811,69,4,5,Ted: There is a new crisis.
20812,69,4,5,Lily: Great! What is it?
20813,69,4,5,Flashback
20814,69,4,5,Stella and Ted are in their rooms.
20815,69,4,5,"Stella: My daughter, my daughter does not come to our wedding."
20816,69,4,5,Ted: What?
20817,69,4,5,"Stella: Tony was the lead here tomorrow, but cash hurt my marriage, and he will not take him. It's been 5 years. Why not turn the page?"
20818,69,4,5,End flashback
20819,69,4,5,"Ted: So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage."
20820,69,4,5,Nora: You are Barney?
20821,69,4,5,Barney: Yes.
20822,69,4,5,"Nora: I heard you were a real b*st*rd, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding."
20823,69,4,5,Barney: I'm here with someone.
20824,69,4,5,Nora: Bring her.
20825,69,4,5,Lily: You'll never get there.
20826,69,4,5,
20827,69,4,5,Ted is by car.
20828,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): So the morning of my wedding, I made the way home Tony, to take Lucy."
20829,69,4,5,Ted hits Chez Tony.
20830,69,4,5,Ted: We did a little karate?
20831,69,4,5,Tony makes a decision.
20832,69,4,5,"Tony: Sorry, sorry dude. You have my alarm activated defense. You must remember these things. Stay alert, rest life."
20833,69,4,5,Ted: OK.
20834,69,4,5,Tony: What brings you here? I thought you'd be in a bridal suite with my wife.
20835,69,4,5,Ted: Not yet. Soon.
20836,69,4,5,"Tony: That's right, tonight is the big night. Oh, man, you gonna make love to the mother of my daughter."
20837,69,4,5,"Ted: Actually, I've already had s*x many times. Why I always corrects people?"
20838,69,4,5,Tony: You and Stella. You're lucky. I could just... I am very happy for you.
20839,69,4,5,"Ted: Look, here's the thing..."
20840,69,4,5,Tony: You can not take it.
20841,69,4,5,"Ted: Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me."
20842,69,4,5,He shakes Ted in his arms.
20843,69,4,5,"Tony: You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had."
20844,69,4,5,Ted: Let's cuddle.
20845,69,4,5,"Tony: I'm sorry. Lucy is everything to me. I will lose it with this family, I am not one."
20846,69,4,5,Ted: But you're part of.
20847,69,4,5,Tony: I have not been invited to the wedding.
20848,69,4,5,Ted: You are now.
20849,69,4,5,Ted is in a car with Tony and Lucy.
20850,69,4,5,"Tony: ""Road Trip"" OK? (They are on a boat) ""Road Trip 2, back in the car."""
20851,69,4,5,Stella's sister comes to see Barney.
20852,69,4,5,Nora: This is the big day. You hydrate?
20853,69,4,5,"Barney: Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson..."
20854,69,4,5,Nora: Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock.
20855,69,4,5,Barney: I regret to inform you that at this time...
20856,69,4,5,Nora: I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat.
20857,69,4,5,Barney: There are currently no positions available.
20858,69,4,5,Nora: I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.
20859,69,4,5,"Barney: I will not do, huh?"
20860,69,4,5,Lily: No chance.
20861,69,4,5,"Ted, Lucy and Tnny arrive."
20862,69,4,5,Ted: Let me talk to Stella first.
20863,69,4,5,Lucy: Mom! Ted invited Dad!
20864,69,4,5,"Stella: Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that?"
20865,69,4,5,Robin comes up behind Ted.
20866,69,4,5,Robin: What did Ted this time?
20867,69,4,5,Ted and Stella are isolated in their room to talk.
20868,69,4,5,Stella: What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.
20869,69,4,5,Ted: To be fair... your ex is here.
20870,69,4,5,Stella: You've invited!
20871,69,4,5,"Ted: Come on, it's not weird."
20872,69,4,5,"Stella: It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal."
20873,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): The children, if I had left Stella talking to Robin, this story would have ended differently."
20874,69,4,5,Stella speaks with Robin.
20875,69,4,5,Robin: I understand.
20876,69,4,5,Ted talks to Tony.
20877,69,4,5,Tony: I get it.
20878,69,4,5,"Man: For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby."
20879,69,4,5,In 2030...
20880,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): And now, how I met your mother."
20881,69,4,5,Stella: Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream?
20882,69,4,5,Ted (2030): But I have not done.
20883,69,4,5,Ted: You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.
20884,69,4,5,Stella: Of course.
20885,69,4,5,Ted goes to talk to Robin.
20886,69,4,5,Ted: Sorry to have run away like that.
20887,69,4,5,"Robin: It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it..."
20888,69,4,5,Ted: You can not come to the wedding.
20889,69,4,5,Robin: thank you God!
20890,69,4,5,Ted: What?
20891,69,4,5,Robin: It's weird.
20892,69,4,5,Ted: It's not weird.
20893,69,4,5,Robin: It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?
20894,69,4,5,Robin imagine the scene.
20895,69,4,5,"Stella: Take that, bitch! I won!"
20896,69,4,5,"Ted: It was broken, there is more than a year."
20897,69,4,5,"Robin: Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there."
20898,69,4,5,"Ted: So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering."
20899,69,4,5,Robin: That's not it. It's just...
20900,69,4,5,Ted: Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.
20901,69,4,5,"Robin: Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over."
20902,69,4,5,"Ted: It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily..."
20903,69,4,5,Robin: I quit my job.
20904,69,4,5,Ted: You what?
20905,69,4,5,"Robin: I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours."
20906,69,4,5,Ted: What does that mean?
20907,69,4,5,"Robin: You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain."
20908,69,4,5,Ted: I did the rain.
20909,69,4,5,"Robin: It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby."
20910,69,4,5,Ted: I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.
20911,69,4,5,Bartender: Big fight?
20912,69,4,5,Robin: Yes.
20913,69,4,5,Barman: There you go. It is for me.
20914,69,4,5,"Robin: You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop."
20915,69,4,5,Robin knocks on a bedroom door. Barney opens half naked.
20916,69,4,5,Robin: I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?
20917,69,4,5,Barney: Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.
20918,69,4,5,"Robin: I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you."
20919,69,4,5,Barney: No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...
20920,69,4,5,"Robin: And a girl naked, tied to your bed."
20921,69,4,5,"Barney: The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order..."
20922,69,4,5,"Robin: In addition, Barney."
20923,69,4,5,Robin takes his suitcase and leaves. Nora arrives at that time.
20924,69,4,5,"Nora: OK, let's go. Who's that?"
20925,69,4,5,Barney: The girl on reception.
20926,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different. (Robin is on board a boat, Ted is in his room and read a map and Stella is also on board) In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage. (Stella Tony covers his coat) If only I had understood what it was about."
20927,69,4,5,Flashback
20928,69,4,5,Ted and Stella discuss.
20929,69,4,5,Stella: Have his former close... it reveals unresolved problems.
20930,69,4,5,End flashback
20931,69,4,5,Lily and Ted joined Marshall in the room.
20932,69,4,5,Flashback
20933,69,4,5,"Stella: With your ex not far, which tells you that the flame will not turn back?"
20934,69,4,5,End flashback
20935,69,4,5,Barney joined them in turn.
20936,69,4,5,Flashback
20937,69,4,5,Stella: It's as if it was not over between you.
20938,69,4,5,Ted and Stella are in the restaurant.
20939,69,4,5,"Stella: I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ""ready"" for it."
20940,69,4,5,Tony is in the arms of Ted.
20941,69,4,5,Tony: You see all... made me realize what I had.
20942,69,4,5,Back at the restaurant...
20943,69,4,5,Stella: I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.
20944,69,4,5,End flashback
20945,69,4,5,"Ted (2030): Seriously, kids, do not invite your ex to your wedding."
20946,70,4,6,"Ted (2030): Children, on your wedding day should be the happiest of your life, the culmination of a perfect love story. My marriage, at least the first has not gone so well."
20947,70,4,6,"Ted reads the word of Stella while she on a boat, kissing Tony."
20948,70,4,6,Ted is with his friends at McClaren's.
20949,70,4,6,"Ted: It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess."
20950,70,4,6,"Lily: Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours."
20951,70,4,6,"Ted: I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!"
20952,70,4,6,"He rises from his chair, dancing and going to turn the jukebox."
20953,70,4,6,"Barney: I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!"
20954,70,4,6,Marshall: How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.
20955,70,4,6,"Barney: Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others."
20956,70,4,6,"Lily: No, it is a mess."
20957,70,4,6,Ted: It gauze?
20958,70,4,6,Lily: A mess. And one must be there for him.
20959,70,4,6,"Ted (2030): But all my friends wanted to be there for me, I would, seemingly, well."
20960,70,4,6,"Lily and Robin arrives at the apartment, a pizza in hand and beers."
20961,70,4,6,"Lily: Hey, man."
20962,70,4,6,Robin: You wanna hang out?
20963,70,4,6,"Ted: Girls, I'm fine."
20964,70,4,6,Marshall has a glove and a baseball ball.
20965,70,4,6,"Marshall: Dude, you make some?"
20966,70,4,6,Ted: I'm fine.
20967,70,4,6,Barney entered the apartment with two women.
20968,70,4,6,"Barney: Hey, kid."
20969,70,4,6,"Ted: Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies."
20970,70,4,6,Barney: I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.
20971,70,4,6,GENERIC
20972,70,4,6,The band is at the bar...
20973,70,4,6,"Ted (2030): Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow."
20974,70,4,6,Ted: What do you want for dinner?
20975,70,4,6,"Lily: Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry."
20976,70,4,6,Marshall: We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions?
20977,70,4,6,Flashback
20978,70,4,6,"Marshall is in the arms of Ted, on the couch, crying."
20979,70,4,6,Marshall: It... I... miss him so much.
20980,70,4,6,End flashback
20981,70,4,6,"Robin: Yeah man, you've been a rock."
20982,70,4,6,"Marshall: I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily."
20983,70,4,6,"Lily: Super. Thank you, Ted."
20984,70,4,6,"Marshall: I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!"
20985,70,4,6,Ted: It's OK.
20986,70,4,6,"Barney: Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?"
20987,70,4,6,Ted: It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.
20988,70,4,6,Robin: Why?
20989,70,4,6,"Ted: It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going."
20990,70,4,6,"Robin: Ok, how about Hurley's?"
20991,70,4,6,Ted: Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.
20992,70,4,6,"Lily: Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?"
20993,70,4,6,Ted: Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.
20994,70,4,6,"Barney: Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?"
20995,70,4,6,Ted: Of course. Look at this.
20996,70,4,6,"Ted pulls out a map of Manhattan, half colored red."
20997,70,4,6,Robin: It's that thing?
20998,70,4,6,Ted: A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea
20999,70,4,6,Lily: This is ridiculous.
21000,70,4,6,Robin: The sea is blue.
21001,70,4,6,Lily: You can not live like this.
21002,70,4,6,"Marshall: It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?"
21003,70,4,6,"Ted: Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this."
21004,70,4,6,"Marshall: It's that ""one"" small dicks?"
21005,70,4,6,"Ted: No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?"
21006,70,4,6,Lily: Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.
21007,70,4,6,Ted: Super. Let's go.
21008,70,4,6,"Barney, Robin, Ted, Marshall and Lily are in the restaurant."
21009,70,4,6,Waiter: Have you decided?
21010,70,4,6,Ted: Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?
21011,70,4,6,Waiter: Certainly.
21012,70,4,6,"Ted: Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?"
21013,70,4,6,Lily: I actually remember it. Oh Oh!
21014,70,4,6,Robin: What?
21015,70,4,6,Lily: I remember.
21016,70,4,6,Ted turns around and sees Stella.
21017,70,4,6,"Ted: Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me."
21018,70,4,6,He hides under the table.
21019,70,4,6,"Marshall: Oh, you laugh."
21020,70,4,6,Lily: He is serious?
21021,70,4,6,"Barney: I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one."
21022,70,4,6,Robin: She turns around.
21023,70,4,6,Everyone is hiding under the table.
21024,70,4,6,"Ted: Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look."
21025,70,4,6,Server: Do you want covered?
21026,70,4,6,"Stella: No, I'm going home."
21027,70,4,6,Marshall: She took to win.
21028,70,4,6,Ted: She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?
21029,70,4,6,Barney: Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella.
21030,70,4,6,Marshall: Will the yelling.
21031,70,4,6,"Lily: You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!"
21032,70,4,6,Ted: Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.
21033,70,4,6,Lily: I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.
21034,70,4,6,"Ted: Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?"
21035,70,4,6,Lily: How dare you pronounce this name to me?
21036,70,4,6,Robin: Who is Gazeur?
21037,70,4,6,Lily: This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school.
21038,70,4,6,Flashback
21039,70,4,6,Lily is in progress.
21040,70,4,6,"Lily: Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day..."
21041,70,4,6,We hear someone fart.
21042,70,4,6,End flashback
21043,70,4,6,"Barney: Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty."
21044,70,4,6,Robin: You did what?
21045,70,4,6,Lily: Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice.
21046,70,4,6,Flashback
21047,70,4,6,"Lily: Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze?"
21048,70,4,6,Purifier: It was not me. That was it.
21049,70,4,6,Lily: Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur!
21050,70,4,6,Purifier: I'm in the team baseball. I'm cool.
21051,70,4,6,End flashback
21052,70,4,6,"Lily: The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools."
21053,70,4,6,Barney: The kids are great.
21054,70,4,6,"Lily: It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us."
21055,70,4,6,"Robin: Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome."
21056,70,4,6,The server slides under the table.
21057,70,4,6,Server: It's going guys?
21058,70,4,6,"Ted: Let's just eat here, if possible."
21059,70,4,6,Server: This is your almonds.
21060,70,4,6,Ted: Thank you. You have a daily special?
21061,70,4,6,"Marshall: Ted, this is ridiculous."
21062,70,4,6,"Barney: I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of ""girls that I skipped""... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time."
21063,70,4,6,"Ted: Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?"
21064,70,4,6,Barney: Son of a bitch.
21065,70,4,6,Host: Who is Becca Delucci?
21066,70,4,6,Barney: Do you mind?
21067,70,4,6,Robin: Who is Becca Delucci?
21068,70,4,6,Barney: Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.
21069,70,4,6,"Ted: Where exactly in the north, Barney?"
21070,70,4,6,Barney: Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.
21071,70,4,6,Flashback
21072,70,4,6,Barney is in the parlor with a woman.
21073,70,4,6,"Barney: And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature."
21074,70,4,6,End flashback
21075,70,4,6,Lily: That's not true?
21076,70,4,6,"Barney: Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up."
21077,70,4,6,Flashback
21078,70,4,6,"Barney: I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?"
21079,70,4,6,Woman: You're the only thing that kept me here.
21080,70,4,6,"Barney: That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. (He hangs up with the first woman prisoner and will talk to another who has just arrived) Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output."
21081,70,4,6,"Woman: Hell, no!"
21082,70,4,6,The first woman throws herself on the other woman.
21083,70,4,6,End flashback
21084,70,4,6,"Barney: Now I have letters from Becca who say, ""I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. ""Women, eh?"
21085,70,4,6,Ted: You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table.
21086,70,4,6,Marshall: We do not need. Stella is a party.
21087,70,4,6,"Ted: Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace..."
21088,70,4,6,"Marshall: It comes back. (They go back under the table) We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney? (Barney is in the next table) We think you should talk to him."
21089,70,4,6,Robin: Not me.
21090,70,4,6,Marshall: What?
21091,70,4,6,"Robin: If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him."
21092,70,4,6,Ted: Really?
21093,70,4,6,Lily: Who is it?
21094,70,4,6,Robin: My father.
21095,70,4,6,"Barney: Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?"
21096,70,4,6,Lily: From Robin's father.
21097,70,4,6,Robin: I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.
21098,70,4,6,Lily: Why?
21099,70,4,6,Flashback
21100,70,4,6,A woman is giving birth.
21101,70,4,6,Robin: It goes back to my birth.
21102,70,4,6,"Man: Come on, give me my son. Grows."
21103,70,4,6,End flashback
21104,70,4,6,Robin: He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.
21105,70,4,6,Ted: How so?
21106,70,4,6,"Robin: My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse."
21107,70,4,6,Flashback
21108,70,4,6,Robin's father gives him a gun.
21109,70,4,6,"Robin: At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to shoot a deer."
21110,70,4,6,"Father of Robin: Trivia, RJ Shoot a deer is the most noble goals."
21111,70,4,6,Robin: But they're cute.
21112,70,4,6,Father: You said the same about our rabbits. You remember how they were delicious?
21113,70,4,6,End flashback
21114,70,4,6,Robin: My body started to change...
21115,70,4,6,"Barney: Wait a second. Sorry, continues."
21116,70,4,6,Robin: It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.
21117,70,4,6,Flashback
21118,70,4,6,"Robin: The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the ""Squamish Invitational."" And everybody came to my house to celebrate."
21119,70,4,6,"Father: Guys, you have behaved splendidly there on the ice.Splendidly. You go outside. I come back with soft drinks and pretzels."
21120,70,4,6,"Boy: I can not believe you hast missed the last shot, silly."
21121,70,4,6,Robin: You're an idiot.
21122,70,4,6,"Boy: No, it's you, the idiot."
21123,70,4,6,"Robin and kissing the boy when his father returns, and drops the tray."
21124,70,4,6,"Father: What do you do? You are teammates, hockey players.Teammates do not kiss! Hockey players do not kiss! Oh, my God. I have no son."
21125,70,4,6,End flashback
21126,70,4,6,"Barney: My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door."
21127,70,4,6,"Marshall: It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game."
21128,70,4,6,Robin: And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.
21129,70,4,6,Barney: The blue line?
21130,70,4,6,"Robin: You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that ""crease"" speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff."
21131,70,4,6,Lily: You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?
21132,70,4,6,"Robin: That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? ""I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. """
21133,70,4,6,"Ted: You kept it for quite some time, eh?"
21134,70,4,6,Robin: Yes.
21135,70,4,6,Ted: It has returned to you.
21136,70,4,6,Marshall: Sorry.
21137,70,4,6,Barney: It's hot.
21138,70,4,6,"Ted (2030): And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me."
21139,70,4,6,"Ted: I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up."
21140,70,4,6,"Barney: There, there."
21141,70,4,6,
21142,70,4,6,They leave the restaurant and the taxi from Stella.
21143,70,4,6,Ted: There she is!
21144,70,4,6,"Ted, Barney, Robin, Marshall and Lily are in a taxi."
21145,70,4,6,"Ted: I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?"
21146,70,4,6,"Marshall: Well, well you do. You're going to confront it."
21147,70,4,6,Ted: I will face it.
21148,70,4,6,Robin: This is so exciting.
21149,70,4,6,Ted: Bluntly.
21150,70,4,6,Lily: You're gonna say what?
21151,70,4,6,"Ted: I will say, ""Sorry it did not work. ""We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before."
21152,70,4,6,"Barney: You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted."
21153,70,4,6,Marshall: You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.
21154,70,4,6,"Ted: Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was..."
21155,70,4,6,Marshall: Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.
21156,70,4,6,Ted: That's his problem.
21157,70,4,6,"Barney: Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar."
21158,70,4,6,Robin: I understand!
21159,70,4,6,Ted: In the name of all that is sacred...
21160,70,4,6,"Lily: Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel."
21161,70,4,6,"Robin: Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?"
21162,70,4,6,Ted: Maybe she goes to his office.
21163,70,4,6,Marshall: No.
21164,70,4,6,Flashback
21165,70,4,6,At the restaurant...
21166,70,4,6,"Marshall: The waiter asked him: ""Do you want covered? ""And she said:"" I'm going home. """
21167,70,4,6,End flashback
21168,70,4,6,"Ted: If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. ""At home"" is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!"
21169,70,4,6,"Marshall: Finally. Finally, my friend."
21170,70,4,6,Ted: I have the balls too!
21171,70,4,6,"Marshall: I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry!"
21172,70,4,6,Ted: Me too!
21173,70,4,6,"Marshall: Lets get out, man, let out."
21174,70,4,6,Lily: She stops.
21175,70,4,6,Ted: That's it. That's it!
21176,70,4,6,"Marshall: Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy!"
21177,70,4,6,Robin: Get rid of your demons!
21178,70,4,6,Barney: I have ants in my leg!
21179,70,4,6,"Lily: OK, wait. Wait..."
21180,70,4,6,Marshall: What are you doing?
21181,70,4,6,"Lily: Wait. Listen, Ted, it's great that you're angry..."
21182,70,4,6,Marshall: Sure.
21183,70,4,6,"Lily:... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say."
21184,70,4,6,"Ted: I know exactly what I say. (Ted comes out of the taxi) You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye."
21185,70,4,6,"Stella: Ted, wait."
21186,70,4,6,"Ted: Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life."
21187,70,4,6,Stella: I know.
21188,70,4,6,Ted: Okay. (Ted is still in the taxi) This is what I say.
21189,70,4,6,Marshall: It kills!
21190,70,4,6,Barney: From cold blood.
21191,70,4,6,"Lily: Okay, tell him that."
21192,70,4,6,Ted down the taxi and went to see Stella who does the same.
21193,70,4,6,"Ted (2030): So I got out of the cab, ready to tell her everything, ready to explode but then..."
21194,70,4,6,"Tony is dating his daughter, Lucy in her arms."
21195,70,4,6,Lucy: Mom!
21196,70,4,6,"Ted (2030): Here we go at once. And it was over. At this point, I was not angry. I saw that she was made to be with him.Children, you might think that the only choices are to swallow his anger, or swing at someone. There is another option: you can let it flow, and when you do that, we can forget and move forward. And that was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.It was just not mine. Mine was always there, waiting for me."
21197,71,4,7,Ted's friends are in McClaren's.
21198,71,4,7,"Barney: I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars."
21199,71,4,7,Ted: And those girls over there? They are cannon.
21200,71,4,7,Barney: Absolutely not.
21201,71,4,7,"Lily: Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known."
21202,71,4,7,Robin: You hate me?
21203,71,4,7,Lily: A max.
21204,71,4,7,"Marshall: Barney, they are canon."
21205,71,4,7,"Barney: There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod."
21206,71,4,7,Ted: Anything.
21207,71,4,7,Barney: Look at it carefully. Individually.
21208,71,4,7,Marshall: I know. The last one is kinda cute.
21209,71,4,7,"Lily: Yeah, really cute."
21210,71,4,7,"Barney: And this, my friends, is ""the effect cheerleaders."" Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed. (His phone rings) Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember."
21211,71,4,7,Ted: What?
21212,71,4,7,"Barney: Apparently, I'll be a father."
21213,71,4,7,GENERIC
21214,71,4,7,Ted: You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?
21215,71,4,7,Barney: It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.
21216,71,4,7,Lily: That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.
21217,71,4,7,"Barney: No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?"
21218,71,4,7,Barney leaves the bar.
21219,71,4,7,"Ted (2030): When you're 30 and you're a couple, something weird happens."
21220,71,4,7,Flashback
21221,71,4,7,Lily and Marshall are sitting on the steps at the entrance of the apartment. Several strollers pass and they get excited to see them.
21222,71,4,7,Ted (2030): You start to see babies everywhere.
21223,71,4,7,"Then a woman walks with a dog and a child on his stomach, followed by several puppies Marshall: Go."
21224,71,4,7,Ted (2030): Marshall and Lily caught baby fever. And their neighbors did not help.
21225,71,4,7,Marshall and Lily are their neighbors.
21226,71,4,7,"Marshall: You have not lost a sock, little guy? This is probably the cutest little thing I've ever seen."
21227,71,4,7,Woman: That's my little plug!
21228,71,4,7,"Ted (2030): That night, they had a serious discussion and hands-on children."
21229,71,4,7,"Marshall and Lily are in their apartment, sitting on the couch."
21230,71,4,7,"Lily: So if you have a baby, you think you can work less?"
21231,71,4,7,"Marshall: No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day."
21232,71,4,7,Lily: And for the money? It has a ton of debt.
21233,71,4,7,Marshall: We count the unpaid bills on her pretty little fingers.Let's make a baby.
21234,71,4,7,Lily: Now?
21235,71,4,7,Ted (2030): There was just one problem.
21236,71,4,7,Robin: Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.
21237,71,4,7,"Marshall: So, Robin, when you're in for the job and apartment?"

21253,71,4,7,"Barney: Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?"
21254,71,4,7,Marshall: It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.

21339,71,4,7,"Robin: It comes down to one word: ""you"". Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Lily Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?"
21340,71,4,7,Lily: The sock Jeremy. I will make a baby.

21436,71,4,7,Marshall: Baby...
21437,71,4,7,Lily: I blame myself for last night. I was really painful. I just panicked at the thought of whether we are ready to parent. But you are so well taken care of me. I know you're gonna be a good father.

21495,72,4,8,"Ted: ""It is not a company. It is a collective. """
21496,72,4,8,"Barney: I know. ""We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower. """
21497,72,4,8,"Marshall: Sweden, this is not France. You know that?"
21498,72,4,8,"Barney: It's France. No matter, I told Bilson..."

21500,72,4,8,"Barney: Bislon, saving your..."

21502,72,4,8,"Barney: No, I get up, and I told Bilson..."

21505,72,4,8,End flashback
21506,72,4,8,Barney: Music. Imagine a patriotic music.
21507,72,4,8,Flashback
21508,72,4,8,"Barney: Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that..."
21509,72,4,8,"Bilson: Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?"
21510,72,4,8,Barney: Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.
21511,72,4,8,End flashback
21512,72,4,8,"Barney: All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours."
21513,72,4,8,Ted: You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?
21514,72,4,8,"Barney: It's not the best. We three, we'll work together."
21515,72,4,8,Marshall: Ted will come to call.
21516,72,4,8,"Barney: Yes, totally."
21517,72,4,8,Ted: What is it?
21518,72,4,8,Barney: It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...
21519,72,4,8,Flashback
21520,72,4,8,Marshall is in his office with two men. Barney comes to see.
21521,72,4,8,"Barney: Marshall, the teleconference begins soon."
21522,72,4,8,"Marshall: Sorry, I gotta go."
21523,72,4,8,Barney: And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.
21524,72,4,8,Barney and Marshall are on the roof.
21525,72,4,8,Marshall: It's great. Drinking at work.
21526,72,4,8,"Barney: Basically, it is of ""Mad Men."""
21527,72,4,8,"Marshall: Yes! There is too much ""Mad Men""!"
21528,72,4,8,Barney: I'll spank a secretary.
21529,72,4,8,Marshall: That's exactly what they would do in this series.
21530,72,4,8,Barney: What series?
21531,72,4,8,End flashback
21532,72,4,8,Barney: And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.
21533,72,4,8,Marshall: I do not do that.
21534,72,4,8,Ted: I love to do that.
21535,72,4,8,Barney: I will realize your dream.
21536,72,4,8,"Ted: Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me."
21537,72,4,8,"Ted (2030): It was true. You see, children, when I became an architect, I had a dream... contribute to building a panorama of New York. I wanted to point one of these buildings and say, ""See that? That right there? This is mine. ""This job was the opportunity to realize that."
21538,72,4,8,Robin and Lily walk into a bar.
21539,72,4,8,"Robin: Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?"
21540,72,4,8,"Lily: No. Believe me, it's not his style. She must not know what kind of place this is."
21541,72,4,8,"Jillian: We're here, my little p *** sexy! We just get served!"
21542,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21543,72,4,8,"Lily: Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo."
21544,72,4,8,Flashback
21545,72,4,8,"Ted (2030): What is Woo? Let me explain. Woo is a kind of a young woman, who, like the cuckoo and the nightingale, takes its name from its singular it produces. Also, a Woo can be triggered in different ways. On one particular song on the jukebox..."
21546,72,4,8,"Jillian: My God, this song is my story too."
21547,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21548,72,4,8,"Ted (2030):... to a cheap shooter. On a ride on a mechanical bull... up, everything and anything."
21549,72,4,8,"Jillian: Oh my God, I was afraid of not having fed the cat, then I remembered that I had done."
21550,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21551,72,4,8,End flashback
21552,72,4,8,"Lily: I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo."
21553,72,4,8,Robin: It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo.
21554,72,4,8,"At the apartment, Ted shows his drawing to Barney."
21555,72,4,8,"Ted: Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft."
21556,72,4,8,"Barney: Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless."
21557,72,4,8,"Ted: My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?"
21558,72,4,8,"Barney: No, that's fine."
21559,72,4,8,Marshall enters the apartment.
21560,72,4,8,"Marshall: Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos."
21561,72,4,8,Barney runs out.
21562,72,4,8,"The bar ""Gippy Ups..."
21563,72,4,8,"Jillian: My God, girls, my breast just out of my top bar. And no! I took it out for a drink blackjack!"
21564,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21565,72,4,8,"Robin: So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?"
21566,72,4,8,"Jillian: If rewarding. I dunno if you know the RIE method, but it derives from the philosophy of progressive education Steiner founded the Waldorf school, which is... Oh my God, I love this song! Come on bitches, let's dance!"
21567,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21568,72,4,8,"Jillian: You too, my ****** s."
21569,72,4,8,Lily: No thank you... drag ignorant.
21570,72,4,8,"Barney: Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd."
21571,72,4,8,Lily: You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.
21572,72,4,8,"Barney: Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist."
21573,72,4,8,Lily: None of this stuff...
21574,72,4,8,"Barney: Industry shooters memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when ""Brown Eyed Girl"" happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And ""Brown Eyed Girl."" But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?"
21575,72,4,8,Jillian: Who wants to name my tits?
21576,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21577,72,4,8,"Barney: Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine."
21578,72,4,8,"Ted (2030): The weeks that followed, I immersed myself in work. It was great to be on a project I really wanted to heart.Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived."
21579,72,4,8,"Ted presents his project, the company Barney."
21580,72,4,8,"Ted: And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen."
21581,72,4,8,Ted (2030): I came out pretty confident about my chances.That evening I met Barney.
21582,72,4,8,Barney is sitting on the steps of a building.
21583,72,4,8,"Ted: Hey, Barney! Give me the good news."
21584,72,4,8,Barney: You did not have.
21585,72,4,8,Ted: What?
21586,72,4,8,Barney: The Board... Sven decided to choose.
21587,72,4,8,Woman (in a limo): Wooo!
21588,72,4,8,In McClaren's...
21589,72,4,8,Ted: I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?
21590,72,4,8,Barney: I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.
21591,72,4,8,Ted: It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.
21592,72,4,8,"Marshall: You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?"
21593,72,4,8,Ted: I think I need it.
21594,72,4,8,Barney: Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.
21595,72,4,8,They leave when Robin arrives.
21596,72,4,8,Robin: It's been what?
21597,72,4,8,Lily: Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.
21598,72,4,8,Robin: What?
21599,72,4,8,Lily: You were seen to Woo.
21600,72,4,8,"Robin: Given that, do Woo?"
21601,72,4,8,Lily: You who did Woo?
21602,72,4,8,Robin: I have not done Woo.
21603,72,4,8,"Lily: Oh, yes."
21604,72,4,8,Robin: That's not true.
21605,72,4,8,Lily: Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now?
21606,72,4,8,"Robin: It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not."
21607,72,4,8,Lily: Like what?
21608,72,4,8,"Robin: As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo."
21609,72,4,8,Lily: I can Woo.
21610,72,4,8,Robin: That's not true.
21611,72,4,8,Lily: But if.
21612,72,4,8,"Robin: It's not you, that."
21613,72,4,8,
21614,72,4,8,Marshall is in his office when Bilson from the corridor.
21615,72,4,8,"Marshall: Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job."
21616,72,4,8,Bilson: Yes. I voted for him.
21617,72,4,8,Barney is in the meeting room.
21618,72,4,8,Barney: It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.
21619,72,4,8,Marshall: Teleconference. Now.
21620,72,4,8,Barney leaves the room and climbed onto the roof with Marshall.
21621,72,4,8,Marshall: You wanna tell me something?
21622,72,4,8,Barney: Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.
21623,72,4,8,Marshall: Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?
21624,72,4,8,Barney: Okay.
21625,72,4,8,Flashback
21626,72,4,8,Ted presents his project.
21627,72,4,8,"Ted:... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen."
21628,72,4,8,Ted leaves the room.
21629,72,4,8,Barney: So?
21630,72,4,8,Bilson: It was great. I like it.
21631,72,4,8,Barney: It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...
21632,72,4,8,"Man: I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront. You are new and fresh.Women want to be with you, men want to hurt you, but the fool who dares challenge you will be crushed! Your home office will show the world these facts. And one more thing... Do not look now! (It shows a dinosaur) Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?"
21633,72,4,8,"Barney: Oh, my God. It's me!"
21634,72,4,8,"Sven: You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus."
21635,72,4,8,"Barney: I've never known so far, but I've always wanted."
21636,72,4,8,"Sven: On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button."
21637,72,4,8,Barney: What does this button?
21638,72,4,8,Sven: Press! Press for the glory!
21639,72,4,8,Barney supports and fire proceeds from the mouth of the dinosaur.
21640,72,4,8,Barney: It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome.
21641,72,4,8,"Sven: There is a striptease club in the letter ""N""."
21642,72,4,8,End flashback
21643,72,4,8,"Marshall: What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small."
21644,72,4,8,Barney: It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.
21645,72,4,8,Marshall: You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.
21646,72,4,8,"Barney: It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall."
21647,72,4,8,"Marshall: ""Fire Marshall""."
21648,72,4,8,Barney: I have not even paid attention.
21649,72,4,8,Marshall: How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.
21650,72,4,8,"Barney: I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons."
21651,72,4,8,"Marshall: No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend."
21652,72,4,8,Barney: Like what?
21653,72,4,8,"Marshall: Because, that."
21654,72,4,8,"It removes the extinguisher that held the door and closes it, leaving Barney alone on the roof. Several pigeons land on the edge of the roof."
21655,72,4,8,"Back at the Bar ""Gippy Ups""..."
21656,72,4,8,"Jillian: My God, girls. Yesterday, we collected $ 10 000 for my charity that fights illiteracy children. It's a real problem."
21657,72,4,8,Robin: Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!
21658,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21659,72,4,8,Lily: Wooo!
21660,72,4,8,Robin: What are you doing here?
21661,72,4,8,Lily: The same things are funny as singles.
21662,72,4,8,Robin: That's what the fireman's helmet?
21663,72,4,8,"Lily: I had no cowboy hat, and it was the day of fire safety at school... My God, ***** s. This is our theme."
21664,72,4,8,Robin: Really? Who sings that?
21665,72,4,8,Lily: LL Cool J stuff always comes out?
21666,72,4,8,Barney is still on the roof but Sven had joined him.
21667,72,4,8,"Barney: That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?"
21668,72,4,8,Sven: I do not understand. Where is the call?
21669,72,4,8,"Barney: It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great."
21670,72,4,8,Sven: It's a waste of time. Pumps!
21671,72,4,8,"The ""Gippy Ups""..."
21672,72,4,8,"Jillian: Misty, you're a real slut. We get another shot."
21673,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21674,72,4,8,"Misty: It's you, the slut, drag. It is you who pays."
21675,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21676,72,4,8,"Woman: No, ***** s, it is you who pays. You're too p *** a."
21677,72,4,8,All: Wooo!
21678,72,4,8,Lily: You are a bunch of prostitutes. You must have STDs.
21679,72,4,8,Jillian: Come and dance.
21680,72,4,8,"Robin: Lily, it does not work. You should not be there."
21681,72,4,8,"Lily: I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck?"
21682,72,4,8,"Robin: On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his gun t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo."
21683,72,4,8,Lily: You say that to make me feel not like an old married.
21684,72,4,8,Robin: Look at those girls. Look at them and listen to what they mean Woo.
21685,72,4,8,"Woman: Wooo! (""I cry in the shower!"")"
21686,72,4,8,"Misty: Wooo! (""I've never had a second date!"")"
21687,72,4,8,"Jillian: Wooo! (""And if I was ever mother?"")"
21688,72,4,8,"Woman 2: Wooo! (""I'm secretly in love with Jillian!"")"
21689,72,4,8,"Ted: Wooo! (""My career and my love life going nowhere!"")"
21690,72,4,8,Lily: The poor girls... and Ted. I want to give them a hug.
21691,72,4,8,"Robin: Right now I am like them. I have no job, no boyfriend, I'm confused. So... occasionally, I need to Woo, but when I need to talk about something concrete, it is to you I turn. You're my best friend."
21692,72,4,8,"Lily: And you, mine. And I promise to dedicate ourselves more time. Marshall did not need to paste something from being done."
21693,72,4,8,Marshall: You have tested those purple shots in test tubes? I took five. I believe that there is no alcohol in it.
21694,72,4,8,Lily: Where did you get that hat?
21695,72,4,8,Marshall: What hat?
21696,72,4,8,Barney: It turned Sven.
21697,72,4,8,Ted: What?
21698,72,4,8,"Barney: Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is: you have the job."
21699,72,4,8,Ted: Really?
21700,72,4,8,"Barney: The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy."
21701,72,4,8,Ted: It's weird.
21702,72,4,8,"Barney: Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted..."
21703,72,4,8,"Marshall: It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid."
21704,72,4,8,Barney: You know...
21705,72,4,8,"Ted: Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (""Now, only my love life is a disaster!"") The next is for me."
21706,72,4,8,Barney: Why you helped me?
21707,72,4,8,"Marshall: You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment."
21708,72,4,8,"Barney: You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall."
21709,72,4,8,"Ted (2030): Marshall eventually cracked and confessed the truth about Barney, like, ten minutes later, so much so that Uncle Barney attached to a mechanical bull, set to position ""Mixed Paint"" and it returned."
21710,72,4,8,"Ted: I love you, man."
21711,72,4,8,"Barney: Me too, buddy."
21712,72,4,8,Ted: You mount the bull?
21713,72,4,8,"Barney: No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem."
21714,72,4,8,Ted (2030): It was a rather brilliant night.
21715,72,4,8,"Hours later, the ""Gippy Ups""... A man stands Barney's mechanical bull."
21716,72,4,8,Man: three hours. This is the record of the bar.
21717,72,4,8,He falls down and the bull.
21718,72,4,8,"Barney: That's right, girls."
21719,72,4,8,"Woman: You know what would be really crazy, funny and stupid to do tonight? If you and I, we found a guy to do it for three."
21720,72,4,8,Jillian: Maybe... If we find the right guy.
21721,72,4,8,"Barney tries to see the two young women, but falls."
21722,72,4,8,"Woman: Yes, and... if there is not the right guy, both could just..."
21723,72,4,8,"Jillian: You know who is more cute? This guy, Ted. Come and get it."
21724,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): Children, it is believed all know how long it takes to recover from a breakup."
21725,73,4,9,"At the apartment of Lily and Marshall, Lily and Ted in the kitchen."
21726,73,4,9,Lily: Half the time the relationship.
21727,73,4,9,Marshall: One week per month spent together.
21728,73,4,9,"At the apartment, Ted is sitting on the couch with Robin."
21729,73,4,9,"Robin: Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes."
21730,73,4,9,It is now McClaren's with Barney.
21731,73,4,9,Barney: You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!
21732,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): But you're beginning to recover when you meet the person who puts you in the game. This is the story of how I met this person. (Ted takes the elevator with a woman. She goes out and Ted is in the elevator) Children, if you go swimming, you immerse them directly. (Another, he finds himself again in the elevator with the woman) First, you dip your toe in the water."
21733,73,4,9,Ted: Hi.
21734,73,4,9,Woman: Hi.
21735,73,4,9,"She goes back to the elevator. And the next day, they are again in the elevator together."
21736,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): You take the temperature, to get an impression."
21737,73,4,9,Ted: For me it's Ted.
21738,73,4,9,Wife Vicky.
21739,73,4,9,"Then she goes out. Another day, between Ted and then take the elevator to spring. Vicky arrives and does the same. The elevator reaches the ground floor and ride the elevator together."
21740,73,4,9,Ted (2030): And you come back gently into the water.
21741,73,4,9,"Ted: I was left on the altar, there is one month."
21742,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): Or, you know, the bomb."
21743,73,4,9,"Ted: It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?"
21744,73,4,9,Vicky: Yes.
21745,73,4,9,GENERIC
21746,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): Children, I saw a bunch of crazy stuff on entering the apartment all these years."
21747,73,4,9,Flashback
21748,73,4,9,"On November 26, 2004, Ted returned to the apartment. There are two acrobats and Lily with its range of hand painting."
21749,73,4,9,Lily: Sorry guys. I'll just make a fruit cup.
21750,73,4,9,"July 16, 2007, Barney was handcuffed and locked in a box filled with water."
21751,73,4,9,Marshall: It's been 12 minutes!
21752,73,4,9,"December 15, 2006, Robin holds a gun in his hands and also two men, including one on TV under his arm."
21753,73,4,9,Robin: Put it!
21754,73,4,9,Man 1: You first!
21755,73,4,9,"Man 2: Why you referred me, Ike?"
21756,73,4,9,Ike: Do not say my name!
21757,73,4,9,Robin: Ask your weapons!

21760,73,4,9,Ted (2030): But one of the craziest things I saw happened when I was a roommate with your Aunt Robin.
21761,73,4,9,Ted returned to the apartment and found a naked man sitting on the couch.
21762,73,4,9,Ted: You're who?
21763,73,4,9,Man Mitch.
21764,73,4,9,"Ted: What are you doing, Mitch?"
21765,73,4,9,Mitch: You must be the roommate. I'm with Robin. She came out to take a call. I think its handheld gaming here.
21766,73,4,9,"Ted: Robin did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now."
21767,73,4,9,Ted left the apartment. Robin is still out on the phone.
21768,73,4,9,"Robin: I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?"
21769,73,4,9,"Ted finds Barney, Marshall and Lil McClaren's in there."
21770,73,4,9,"Ted: Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Robin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch."
21771,73,4,9,Lily: His thing arranged? A real disaster. She sent me text messages all night. She just let go to use the bathroom.
21772,73,4,9,Ted: Excuse me one minute.
21773,73,4,9,He gets up and goes back to the apartment.
21774,73,4,9,"Mitch: Man, you annoy me. I am in action here."
21775,73,4,9,Ted: What action?
21776,73,4,9,"Mitch: This is my technique. It's called, ""The guy with hair."""
21777,73,4,9,"Ted: ""The guy naked?"""
21778,73,4,9,Flashback
21779,73,4,9,Robin returned to the apartment with Mitch.
21780,73,4,9,"Mitch: That's the trick. You're the first date, you've had a few drinks, you go out an excuse to go to the girl."
21781,73,4,9,"Robin: The bathroom is. (His phone rings) You know what, I will respond."
21782,73,4,9,"Mitch: Then when she leaves, you undress and wait for you.When she returns, she laughs. She is so fascinated by your insurance, and your bravado she sleep with you."
21783,73,4,9,End flashback
21784,73,4,9,Ted: No chance it works!
21785,73,4,9,Mitch: Two out of three.
21786,73,4,9,Ted: Two out of three?
21787,73,4,9,"Mitch: Two out of three. You just choose your moment. ""The guy naked"" mostly run as a last resort, the last resort to first appointment when you know that there will be no second."
21788,73,4,9,Ted: How do you know?
21789,73,4,9,Mitch: Look at me.
21790,73,4,9,Ted: I'd rather not.
21791,73,4,9,"Mitch: Robin is not in my division. I'm not smart, funny and handsome. As you can see, there is nothing impressive nowhere there. My only chance with a girl like Robin, is the surprise. And let's be honest, a little pity. This is shock and ""Ohhh."""
21792,73,4,9,Ted: It does not work really.
21793,73,4,9,Mitch: Two out of three. Guaranteed.
21794,73,4,9,Back at the bar...
21795,73,4,9,Marshall: No December '.
21796,73,4,9,Ted: Two out of three. He assured me.
21797,73,4,9,"Barney: Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers."
21798,73,4,9,"Lily: She'll beat him up, yes."
21799,73,4,9,Marshall: It's going to take his gun and shoot him.
21800,73,4,9,They laugh and run off the bar. They arrive at the door where the menu is hung on the doorknob.
21801,73,4,9,Marshall: My God!
21802,73,4,9,Ted: It worked.
21803,73,4,9,Marshall: The business returns for Mr. Popol.
21804,73,4,9,At the bar...
21805,73,4,9,"Barney: ""The naked guy"" works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!"
21806,73,4,9,"Lily: Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?"
21807,73,4,9,"Barney: ""The naked guy"" is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go."
21808,73,4,9,Lily: What kind of gadgets you talking about?
21809,73,4,9,"Ted: So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked."
21810,73,4,9,Robin: I can not tell you.
21811,73,4,9,"Ted: I can not believe that ""The guy with hair 'market has on you."
21812,73,4,9,"Robin: How do you say? I entered and he was naked. It was funny. I laughed, he laughed. And then it happened. I know not."
21813,73,4,9,Marshall: I say ***** s!
21814,73,4,9,Robin: Sorry?
21815,73,4,9,"Marshall: Sorry Robin, but cate with this type suggests that all that separates you from s*x, it's the clothes."
21816,73,4,9,Robin: I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked.
21817,73,4,9,"Marshall: So, why did you lie?"
21818,73,4,9,Robin: Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings.
21819,73,4,9,"Marshall: Because he was naked. Sorry, but I disagree. There is only one reason to sleep with someone, and it is ""love"".Marshall is a big girl because he believes in love and read ""And it was true"" because the secretaries were forced to join the Oprah book club. But you know I'm right."
21820,73,4,9,"Lily: Marshall, I love you, but there are plenty of reasons to lie."
21821,73,4,9,Marshall: Cite me one.
21822,73,4,9,Lily: I will quote 50.
21823,73,4,9,Marshall: You could not.
21824,73,4,9,Lily: Number one: last Thursday.

21826,73,4,9,Marshall and Lily are in bed. Lily does not sleep.
21827,73,4,9,"Lily: Marshall, you wanna do?"
21828,73,4,9,Marshall: I'm here.
21829,73,4,9,End flashback
21830,73,4,9,Marshall: You have defiled the marital bed because you could not sleep?
21831,73,4,9,"Lily: It was you who said, ""This shadow on the ceiling, it looks an awful clown toothless. Good night, Lily. """
21832,73,4,9,Marshall: Okay! It makes one. But I dare you to...
21833,73,4,9,"Lily: I'll give you 50. There's s*x reconciliation... breaking s*x, and s*x ""a friend told you about a new position."""
21834,73,4,9,"Barney: You're welcome. There is also ""revenge"", ""bounce back"", ""parachuting"". When you're traveling, but instead of going to the hotel, you'll live in a bar to find a girl to get a foothold."
21835,73,4,9,"Robin: Oh, that, ""the kiss for a roof."""
21836,73,4,9,Marshall: ***** S!
21837,73,4,9,Robin: I do not. My roommate in college did.
21838,73,4,9,"Marshall: No, Robin, it's just a bad cough. I'm not really a bad cough. We all know that the ""roommate in college,"" it's you, ***** s! Nobody has a Strepsil?"
21839,73,4,9,"Lily: Oh, I have one. s*x ""bugger all on TV."""
21840,73,4,9,"Ted: The s*x ""hotel room""."
21841,73,4,9,"Barney: ""Curiosity,"" style, ""Me have always wondered how to do this is with a great girl."" Big guy not a girl, just great. Like...if a normal girl was 2.10 m, 2.25 m high, and... wearing a mini denim skirt. I wonder how it is."
21842,73,4,9,42 reasons later...
21843,73,4,9,"Robin: s*x, ""He says he loves you, but do not want to say the same."""
21844,73,4,9,Lily: 43.
21845,73,4,9,"Ted: ""The co-pilot who jumps on the grenade to a friend."""
21846,73,4,9,Lily: 44.
21847,73,4,9,"Barney: ""Condoms will expire."""
21848,73,4,9,Lily: 45. It gets a little tough.
21849,73,4,9,Barney: 46!
21850,73,4,9,"Lily: Still 4. ""You make a crisp fall on his knees and the when you picked up, he thinks it is an approach, and it happens."""
21851,73,4,9,Marshall: Thanks for ruining the memory of the anniversary of our six months.
21852,73,4,9,Lily: You gave me some chips.
21853,73,4,9,Marshall: You can stop with this stupid list? You make me sad.
21854,73,4,9,"Lily: No, I have fun. But this thing of a ""partner"", it sucks sometimes. I always talk about you. I can not play ""I never,"" because everyone knows all the quirks that I let you do."
21855,73,4,9,Marshall: The only oddity that I did was to open my heart and my soul when I had put me to hair when the room was empty.
21856,73,4,9,Robin: I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked!Mitch and I have something special. My fingers are crossed.That may be correct.
21857,73,4,9,Marshall: The good? Mitch? The guy naked?
21858,73,4,9,"Barney: You mean the naked genius. All this time I wore a suit when I should have removed it. That's it. I ""The guy naked,"" tonight. And you too."
21859,73,4,9,Ted: What?
21860,73,4,9,"Barney: With the girl from the elevator. You're with her tonight?""Dude naked""!"
21861,73,4,9,"Ted: This is the first girl I had the courage to invite, from Stella."
21862,73,4,9,"Barney: ""Dude naked""!"
21863,73,4,9,Ted: This is the eighth place I try tonight! I cut my hair 3 times! I am out!
21864,73,4,9,Robin: You're makeup?
21865,73,4,9,"Ted: It's not the makeup! It is a sun cream with a subtle shade of... It is for men. It's good, I want my eyes stand out."
21866,73,4,9,"Barney: ""Dude naked""!"
21867,73,4,9,"Ted: No, Barney, I like Vicky. It could be serious. I want to do anything stupid to jeopardize that."

21869,73,4,9,Barney gets up and goes to see the woman at the counter.
21870,73,4,9,Ted (2030): That night we all had something to prove. Robin wanted to defend his honor.
21871,73,4,9,"Robin (on phone): Mitch, baby, that's me. Robin. Want to grab something to eat tonight? Because you're my boyfriend!"
21872,73,4,9,
21873,73,4,9,"Lily is sitting on the couch, when Marshall returns."
21874,73,4,9,Ted (2030): Lily needed to prove she could finish his list.
21875,73,4,9,Lily: I'm stuck. I find it the last 2.
21876,73,4,9,"Marshall: Reason 48: ""To reinforce good behavior, such as shaving or dental hygiene."" Now you conditioned me? Great!That's why I have an erection when I go floss."

21878,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): I had to prove that as scary as it may be out, Stella and I had forgotten I was ready to return. (Barney from the bar with a woman) And Barney had to prove that he too could be ""The guy naked."""

21900,73,4,9,Ted: It's a good question. I have not really thought.

21908,73,4,9,Robin is the restaurant with Mitch.
21909,73,4,9,Robin: It's a pleasure to see you again. I really enjoyed it last night. So how does it feel to hold a Pizza Hut? Who had the idea to put a pineapple in the...
21910,73,4,9,"Mitch: OK, enough. I know what it is. I have already given. This is the hot date ""I'm not a ***** s""."
21911,73,4,9,"Robin: What? It's crazy. Usually, you see clearly in my game, but there you are mistaken."
21912,73,4,9,"Mitch: C'mon, Robin. One of us has had a good time, and you know it's me."
21913,73,4,9,Robin Mitchell... Thing is... not true!
21914,73,4,9,Mitch: Really? How was the s*x?
21915,73,4,9,Robin: I have not hated.
21916,73,4,9,"Mitch: Did you see my technique. That's it. I have nothing to offer you. I am ruined, I sweat when I eat, and I'm in fantasy football leagues 5. I talking about it. Believe me, you want to be."
21917,73,4,9,Robin: What? Of course I do! I did not sleep with you just because you were naked.
21918,73,4,9,"Mitch: But if. And now you pretend that it was more to feel better. Say what you want, at least ""The naked guy"" is honest."

21925,73,4,9,Ted: It's nice home!
21926,73,4,9,"Vicky: Thank you, from you, it's a real compliment. I love you to be an architect, it's fascinating. I could listen to you talk about design structures all night."
21927,73,4,9,"Ted (2030): This is where I saw, lying on the table, a book of love poems by Pablo Neruda. The same issue I had in college. And the bookmark was my favorite poem. Maybe I was wrong about this girl. It was perhaps a future."
21928,73,4,9,Ted: Damn!
21929,73,4,9,He dressed quickly. Vicky returns to the show.
21930,73,4,9,Vicky: And that's it.
21931,73,4,9,Ted: Pablo Neruda.
21932,73,4,9,"Vicky: Yeah, this book is a sh1t. An idiot with whom I left it out there. This is in Mexico. (She returns to the kitchen) You know who writes good poems? Jewel. She has rotten teeth and she lives in a car. It has stuff to tell."

21972,73,4,9,"Mitch: That's the beauty of the ""naked guy."" It gives you just what you need. Nothing more, nothing less. If you'll excuse me, I have to replace the shoulder of one of my quaterbacks imaginary football. He dislocated his shoulder!"
21973,73,4,9,"Ted: A toast... Mitch. The sum of its parts makes him a man.But when it serves its parts, it becomes much more. It does not fit the definition of a hero, but he is the one I needed. The hero who helped me get over the disaster of the failure of my marriage and I was almost back in the saddle. He lives in the shadows. Is this a dream? The truth? A fiction? Damnation?Salvation? It is all that and also, no nothing. Because it is...""The guy with hair."""

21981,74,4,10,Boy 1: Why?

21984,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): Children, I fought just once in my life. And that's how it happened. You know I have recently been abandoned at the altar. And the worst when it comes to us, apart from being abandoned at the altar, is what happens after. A steady stream, persistent and unbearable pity."

21986,74,4,10,"Wendy: Cranberry Vodka, gin and tonic. Scotch and soda."
21987,74,4,10,Ted: Thank you. Can I see the menu?
21988,74,4,10,"Wendy: Ted, I'll get you a menu... but I promise I will return."
21989,74,4,10,"Ted: We'll have to go elsewhere. In this bar, I will always be the guy left at the altar. It sucks!"
21990,74,4,10,Barney: Good times.
21991,74,4,10,Ted: We lost Barney.
21992,74,4,10,Robin: What?
21993,74,4,10,"Lily: There's a girl there in a sweater wrap. He does not listen to a word they say. Hein, Barney?"
21994,74,4,10,Barney: Leave me alone!
21995,74,4,10,"Ted: He understood, there is little time, he could hold a conversation with just the titles of sitcoms ""black"" of the 70s and 80s."
21996,74,4,10,Barney: What's going on?
21997,74,4,10,"Lily: Barney, you wanna go and get my stuff does not Marshall?"
21998,74,4,10,Barney: Diff'rent Strokes.
21999,74,4,10,Man: What is this?
22000,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): I spoke to Doug, children? Not? Well..."
22001,74,4,10,Flashback
22002,74,4,10,In McClaren's...
22003,74,4,10,Ted (2030): Doug Martin was in McClaren's bartender. He was always in the corner.
22004,74,4,10,Barney: You... Been to Ted?
22005,74,4,10,"Ted: It is not play ""You know Ted."""
22006,74,4,10,Barney (a pencil in his nose): I'm dead? (Doug misses and laughs) I'm dead? (It is disguised as a woman) Tonight... I am a lesbian.
22007,74,4,10,Ted (2030): There are three things to know about Doug. The first is that Doug is a bit violent.
22008,74,4,10,"Doug:... collapsed, so he's down. And it hits him! He made this face, trembling. What we did is that we left it there. I ressers?"
22009,74,4,10,Ted (2030): The second is that he was weird about her hair...
22010,74,4,10,Doug: What?
22011,74,4,10,Ted: What?
22012,74,4,10,Doug: You look at my hair?
22013,74,4,10,"Ted: No, sir. Not at all."
22014,74,4,10,Doug: That's a dummy. It's funny? Want to laugh? It's funny?Why you do not tear out?
22015,74,4,10,Ted: What?
22016,74,4,10,"Doug: Go ahead, tear it out of my head. Go ahead. Want to pull? Go. Go, go and pluck it out. You want to tear my head?Pluck my hairpiece my head. I love you, guys!"
22017,74,4,10,Ted (2030): But the third is that he was very faithful with its regulars.
22018,74,4,10,"Ted, Lily Marshall, Barney and Robin arrive at the bar."
22019,74,4,10,Doug: There they are! You want your table?
22020,74,4,10,All: We will be well by then.
22021,74,4,10,Doug: Yes? Yes?
22022,74,4,10,Ted (2030): Maybe a little too faithful.
22023,74,4,10,"Doug: No, that's right, all right. (He goes to the usual table where Ted and his friends are) Lovebirds! Put it elsewhere, this table is reserved. Here we go! Now! Go! We move, my Father. Here we go. OK, guys, here!"
22024,74,4,10,End flashback
22025,74,4,10,Ted (2030): So that's Doug.
22026,74,4,10,Doug: What is this?
22027,74,4,10,"Ted: Some guys are sitting at our table. But you know, it's good."
22028,74,4,10,"Doug: Let's go, I take care of that."
22029,74,4,10,"Lily: Damn, there goes."
22030,74,4,10,"Doug: Ladies, if you will join your table. Gentlemen, I need your help out."
22031,74,4,10,Ted: Our help?
22032,74,4,10,Doug: We're going down the aisle and fight with these guys.
22033,74,4,10,Barney: What's going on?
22034,74,4,10,GENERIC
22035,74,4,10,"Ted: Sorry, you just said..."
22036,74,4,10,"Doug: These guys are off-handedness. So we go outside and they fit in, OK? It's gonna be fun!"
22037,74,4,10,Doug part.
22038,74,4,10,Ted: He wants to be fought? As with our hands and stuff?
22039,74,4,10,Marshall: And your feet maybe? I do not know the rules.
22040,74,4,10,Ted: A fight. We gotta go?
22041,74,4,10,"Barney: No, I would fight for three things, the closing of a stubborn bra, accusations of sexual harassment... 9 of 9! And wanted to vomit when I see someone wearing brown shoes with a black suit."
22042,74,4,10,"Marshall: The fighting is for dummies. We are civilized people, civilized people not fight. Except with a lightsaber, but that's in for 3 or 5 years..."
22043,74,4,10,Robin: That's not true.
22044,74,4,10,"Marshall: I'm on the forums every day. In 3-5 Thanksgiving, I découperai turkey with my saber green."
22045,74,4,10,"Robin: No, I say there are plenty of legitimate reasons to fight, it is perhaps not beautiful, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do."
22046,74,4,10,"Ted: Yes, I forgot. She is sexy fights."
22047,74,4,10,"Robin: No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties."
22048,74,4,10,"Barney: I lost my wisdom tooth. Without surgery. Local anesthesia. Frankly, it's nothing."
22049,74,4,10,Ted: We should go.
22050,74,4,10,"Lily: I can not believe that we have this discussion. Ted, you're 30, you're too old to act like that."
22051,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): I was 30. And of those 30 years, I was struck once."
22052,74,4,10,Flashback
22053,74,4,10,Ted is in a bar.
22054,74,4,10,Ted: There is an explanation very simp...
22055,74,4,10,A man gives him a punch.
22056,74,4,10,End flashback
22057,74,4,10,Ted (2030): There was this thing in colo.
22058,74,4,10,Flashback
22059,74,4,10,Ted is in the forest with children.
22060,74,4,10,Ted: Today we are going to braid friendship bracelets.
22061,74,4,10,A pat on the boy's private parts and they run off.
22062,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): In college, I studied Kung-Fu. And some other stuff. For the goat, it would be a few months after."
22063,74,4,10,End flashback
22064,74,4,10,Ted (2030): The idea is that I had never beaten.
22065,74,4,10,Ted: I'm going.
22066,74,4,10,Lily: No!
22067,74,4,10,"Marshall: Listen to me, trust me, I fought hard. There is no pride to be learned."
22068,74,4,10,Ted: With which you fought?
22069,74,4,10,Marshall: My brothers.
22070,74,4,10,"Barney: Yeah, it was surely the ruckus in the playroom of Eriksen."
22071,74,4,10,Flashback
22072,74,4,10,Marshall horseplay with his two brothers.
22073,74,4,10,A brother: I love the squabbles between brothers!
22074,74,4,10,Marshall: That's the monster of guilis!
22075,74,4,10,Brother 2: Patrol Commies!
22076,74,4,10,Marshall: Wait! Go! Go! Cocoa break.
22077,74,4,10,End flashback
22078,74,4,10,"Ted: Break cocoa. OK, it's time to fight."
22079,74,4,10,"Lily: Ted, do not do that, you're a good guy. This is your greatest quality."
22080,74,4,10,"Ted: Oh yeah? I seem to remember that this guy was well dumped by his girlfriend for a Taekwondo teacher. It might sound crazy, but... I need that. I think it's an experience I do. I go there."
22081,74,4,10,Ted part.
22082,74,4,10,"Barney: Me too! (Followed by Barney) Guys... watch what face. The next time you see it, it will be distorted as the sexiest possible. Because that's what I am: a real man. I like to fight and do battle in the dirt. You find me a wooden hanger for that?"
22083,74,4,10,Ted and Barney arrive in the driveway but Doug already has to KO the other guy.
22084,74,4,10,Barney: It's been what?
22085,74,4,10,"Doug: I know, huh! Who do now eyeing more my hairpiece?Look what they did!"
22086,74,4,10,"Ted: ""We""?"
22087,74,4,10,"Doug: Yes, ""on"". Come on, we made a great team. Well done guys! We did it!"
22088,74,4,10,"Ted: No, you did. There was nothing we."
22089,74,4,10,"Doug: OK, yes, it is clear, I have beaten three types alone. You and you, free drinks for life."
22090,74,4,10,Doug enters the bar.
22091,74,4,10,Ted: He thinks he fought with him.
22092,74,4,10,Barney: We fought with him. So we will go and tell everyone the legendary story of how we beat types. And everyone will find it great and everyone goes back to bed with me.
22093,74,4,10,"Ted: Come on man, no one will believe we fought, we look at."
22094,74,4,10,"Barney: Oh, it's good..."
22095,74,4,10,Barney gives a blow to itself.
22096,74,4,10,Ted: What are you doing?
22097,74,4,10,Barney: What I should have done there is a lease.
22098,74,4,10,Ted: What?
22099,74,4,10,"Barney: I dunno, I typed the eye! I even know what I say! I have a great right, either. You ready?"
22100,74,4,10,Ted: To go home?
22101,74,4,10,"Barney: No, for that."
22102,74,4,10,Barney gives a blow to Ted.
22103,74,4,10,Ted: You hit me in the nose!
22104,74,4,10,Barney: Are you crying?
22105,74,4,10,"Ted: Yes, I cry! You hit me in the nose!"
22106,74,4,10,"Barney: It's going to swell to death. You're going to look like Owen Wilson. Come on, we go."
22107,74,4,10,"Ted: Ok, but we do not add too. I do not want it to catch proportions."
22108,74,4,10,"Barney enters the bar, followed by Ted. Doug says the fight to include Ted and Barney."
22109,74,4,10,"Doug: Can Ted arrives, takes off her shoe hit him in the mouth... A, they are! The guys who supported me!"
22110,74,4,10,Everyone applauds.
22111,74,4,10,"Always at the bar, but at their usual table..."
22112,74,4,10,Marshall: So you fought. Seriously.
22113,74,4,10,"Ted: No, Barney hit us head to pretend. Without in December ', Marshall!"
22114,74,4,10,Robin: Just look at that eye. You look like a bad boy. I did not know you had it in me. You. That you had it in you.
22115,74,4,10,Barney: You... want to touch?
22116,74,4,10,It affects the eye of Barney.
22117,74,4,10,"Robin: My God, it's hot!"
22118,74,4,10,Doug: The pot of victory! Blackjack! Blackjack! Blackjack!Blackjack! $ 7 50.
22119,74,4,10,Marshall: Why should I pay?
22120,74,4,10,Doug: Because thou hast not supported. They supported me.
22121,74,4,10,"Marshall: You know what, Doug? I will gladly pay. And why?As adults do. They pay their glasses, and they fight it. You know what I did when you were kids? That's what I did."
22122,74,4,10,Barney: Your nails?
22123,74,4,10,Marshall: I was...
22124,74,4,10,Ted: The quiz of love in the last Gala?
22125,74,4,10,Marshall: No. I was...
22126,74,4,10,Barney: your best to not cry when Big came to Carrie at the end of the film s*x and the City?
22127,74,4,10,Marshall: You spoiles? No. I'll tell you what I did...
22128,74,4,10,Robin: Tips to captain the football team because he gave you his ring and you were so cute in your evening gown?
22129,74,4,10,Lily: I'm sorry.
22130,74,4,10,Lily and Marshall are in their beds.
22131,74,4,10,"Marshall: I hate them! They behave like guys the most virile of the universe, as Crocodile Dundee and David Hasselhoff."
22132,74,4,10,Lily: It's the guys the most virile of the universe?
22133,74,4,10,"Marshall: I know why they are given all the attention. In fact, it's me, the real hero."
22134,74,4,10,"Lily: Yeah, it's you."
22135,74,4,10,"Marshall: I'm serious, woman. Put it in your pants."
22136,74,4,10,"Lily: You're the man every boy should be and every girl should marry. You know what? I have two boys under way that will not stop fighting. If you come to school tomorrow to tell them your story of choice of the path of nonviolence, it could put them right. And avoid me getting up early to prepare lessons."
22137,74,4,10,Marshall: Okay. OK. I recadrerai.
22138,74,4,10,
22139,74,4,10,Lily's class...
22140,74,4,10,Boy 1: wimp!
22141,74,4,10,Marshall: What? No! The panda and the koala Mahatma Luther King tell you that story to show...
22142,74,4,10,Boy 2: Show that you're a wimp?
22143,74,4,10,Boy 1: Why hast not beaten? You were afraid?
22144,74,4,10,"Marshall: What? I was not afraid! I did a lot of fights, OK?"
22145,74,4,10,Boy 2: You're great! You have to weigh almost 500 pounds.
22146,74,4,10,"Marshall: First, I wear a sweater off, which has horizontal stripes. And I also... I ate salty... So I... You know what? Shut up!"
22147,74,4,10,Boy 2: wimp! Wimp!
22148,74,4,10,The two boys fight while others cry.
22149,74,4,10,Barney and Ted are in the bar and talk with two women.
22150,74,4,10,Woman 1: So you've just beaten?
22151,74,4,10,Barney: Just?
22152,74,4,10,"Ted: Amanda, was it that simple? You know, the fight in melee, it is more than using force against his opponent, huh B?"
22153,74,4,10,Barney: Exactly!
22154,74,4,10,"Ted: It is an art. The noble art, as it were."
22155,74,4,10,"Woman 2: But I do not understand, what they did to deserve this?"
22156,74,4,10,"Barney: It may seem insignificant, but they got to our table."
22157,74,4,10,Ted: At our table.
22158,74,4,10,Barney: And...
22159,74,4,10,Ted: No one.
22160,74,4,10,Barney:... no one sits at our table.
22161,74,4,10,2 men are sitting at the table.
22162,74,4,10,Amanda: You will beat them up?
22163,74,4,10,Robin arrives at that time.
22164,74,4,10,"Barney: Let's beat them up. Ted, come on. You two. Our table.Go. Now!"
22165,74,4,10,Ted: What are you doing?
22166,74,4,10,"Barney: Relax, it was Doug. Doug supports us."
22167,74,4,10,Ted: He's not here tonight.
22168,74,4,10,Barney: I offer you what? A drink? Money? These two girls over there?
22169,74,4,10,"Man 1: It's you, Ted Mosby."
22170,74,4,10,Ted: Yes.
22171,74,4,10,Male 2: And you're Barney Stinson?
22172,74,4,10,"Barney: They know who you are. All right, guys. It lets you go without kick your ass. This time. Okay?"
22173,74,4,10,Both men are given two envelopes.
22174,74,4,10,Ted: That's... What is it?
22175,74,4,10,Man 2: You are summoned.
22176,74,4,10,Man 1: You are charged with assault. Enjoy it.
22177,74,4,10,The two men leave the bar.
22178,74,4,10,Barney: That was close.
22179,74,4,10,"Barney, Ted and Marshall are at the apartment and watch the invitations."
22180,74,4,10,Ted: Assault! They continue to attack us!
22181,74,4,10,Barney: What is the penalty for assault? I'll have a fine?Picking up garbage on the highway? Because I already did that.
22182,74,4,10,Marshall: I know.
22183,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): In fact, he knew they risked a small community service, surely no criminal charges. But he was furious against us."
22184,74,4,10,Marshall: You could have a good time in prison.
22185,74,4,10,Barney: The Prison?
22186,74,4,10,"Ted: I can not go to jail! I could read a bunch of books, writing short stories. Drag me all the time. Seriously, if I get lost really hefty..."
22187,74,4,10,Barney: You can not go to jail! They are dying in the hallways!And meals are really heavy.
22188,74,4,10,Marshall: You should have thought before beating them.
22189,74,4,10,Ted: And if we have not done?
22190,74,4,10,Marshall: No what?
22191,74,4,10,Ted: beaten. And if Doug had beaten them all alone and we had done nothing?
22192,74,4,10,Marshall: I knew it! You have not even given a single shot.
22193,74,4,10,"Barney: I hit Ted and me, so..."
22194,74,4,10,Marshall: Who's the wimp now? Answer: you.
22195,74,4,10,Ted: You can spin us a hand?
22196,74,4,10,"Marshall: You know the old saying: ""If you can not assume, do not pretend to have done, do not laugh and refuses glasses blackjack and not defend your friend, who, coincidentally, lived full of fights with his brothers. """
22197,74,4,10,"Barney: You gotta help us, Marshall. We're the Three Musketeers! If I let Ted I how long?"
22198,74,4,10,Robin entered the apartment.
22199,74,4,10,"Robin: Barney? I was looking for you. I have tickets for the hockey game tonight. It's stupid. Want to go? It can run late, we could go see a drink after."
22200,74,4,10,"Marshall: Listen to this. You know, this fight? The guys were pretending."
22201,74,4,10,And he left the apartment.
22202,74,4,10,"Robin: Oh, I forgot! Tonight, it is not possible. I can not go to hockey tonight, I have this... This... This..."
22203,74,4,10,She goes into the room.
22204,74,4,10,Back at the bar...
22205,74,4,10,"Marshall: Good news, I talked to the guys."
22206,74,4,10,Ted: What guy?
22207,74,4,10,Marshall: The ones you do not beaten. They will not go to trial.Lawyer.
22208,74,4,10,Barney: What? They dropped?
22209,74,4,10,"Marshall: Yes, I just told them you were wimps. It has made us laugh. Poilade good, actually. I said that you did manicure every month."
22210,74,4,10,"Barney: Weeks, Wolverine... Some are careful."
22211,74,4,10,Marshall: And you played the harp in the dance club of the pre-reform in college.
22212,74,4,10,Ted: You're at least they said we were one of the best medieval music group of the academy?
22213,74,4,10,Marshall: Sure. We were all agreed that it was a guy who had beaten and that you had nothing to do with it...
22214,74,4,10,"Ted: Wait, so... they attack Doug."
22215,74,4,10,Marshall: Affirmative.
22216,74,4,10,"Ted: The angry, irrational, violent Doug, who now knows, you pushed under a bus."
22217,74,4,10,Doug (on phone): They what?
22218,74,4,10,"Marshall, Barney, Lily and Robin are in the driveway with Doug."
22219,74,4,10,Barney: We can tell you...
22220,74,4,10,Doug: Explain what? How you have me stabbed in the back just under my eyes?
22221,74,4,10,"Lily: Robin, I'm afraid."
22222,74,4,10,"Robin: Yeah, Doug sees someone?"
22223,74,4,10,Lily: You visit? You really should.
22224,74,4,10,"Ted: Look, you do not understand, you beat these guys all by yourself."
22225,74,4,10,Marshall: It's true. They have nothing to do with it. Look at them.
22226,74,4,10,Barney: It's Ted's fault!
22227,74,4,10,Barney runs off.
22228,74,4,10,Marshall: Look at him.
22229,74,4,10,"Ted: Yes, look at me!"
22230,74,4,10,Marshall: It would not 5 minutes in combat.
22231,74,4,10,Ted: I could hold at least 5...
22232,74,4,10,Marshall: It is as limp as spaghetti.
22233,74,4,10,"Ted: Yes, spaghetti with meatballs... Mate it. Look!"
22234,74,4,10,Marshall: No.
22235,74,4,10,"Doug: OK, maybe it was... than me. In fact, it makes sense. I have many black holes. In short, I have always supported. I expected much from you. And you did what? Nothing. We can not count on you. No wonder your girlfriend has dumped you."
22236,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): And here, children, the only fight I've ever had.What can I say? For starters, a punch to the face, it hurts...very badly. And what hurts more? Ca (Doug gives him a punch too) All I remember is waking up."
22237,74,4,10,Barney comes running.
22238,74,4,10,"Barney: OK, I'm hot. Let's go."
22239,74,4,10,"Ted: A fight was not a good idea, actually. And that's my story."
22240,74,4,10,Ted tells his story to the class of Lily.
22241,74,4,10,Lily: And what did you learn?
22242,74,4,10,Ted: I learned that it is not right to fight and must never do.
22243,74,4,10,Lily: Questions?
22244,74,4,10,Boy 1: Where you find them?
22245,74,4,10,Boy 2: I know! Was a big sale at the market for wimps?
22246,74,4,10,Children: wimp! Wimp!
22247,74,4,10,And both boys are still fighting.

22253,74,4,10,Ted: Damn!
22254,74,4,10,"Marshall: Apparently, Uncle Marshall and his brothers did more than fight."
22255,74,4,10,Robin: Marshall looks like. He lost weight?
22256,74,4,10,"Lily: S *****, do not even think about."

22258,74,4,10,Ted and his friends at the bar.
22259,74,4,10,"Ted (2030): Children, I would tell you that fighting is malet need to do it, but it's useless. So I tell you this: do you ever fight with Uncle Marshall. It's a big tared."
22260,74,4,10,"Thanksgiving day, 3 to 4 years later... Marshall is with his family at the table."
22261,74,4,10,"Marshall: It's so good to be home. Mom, Lily, good job. ""Good meat, good food, good Lord, to the food. ""No? OK, let's go. Put your glasses. (Everyone dons glasses and takes out a sword Marshall Green) Okay, pass me the plate. Lily, white or red meat?"

22263,75,4,11,"Ted, Marshall and Lily are in McClaren's when Robin joins them."
22264,75,4,11,Robin: Hi!
22265,75,4,11,Marshall: Hi.
22266,75,4,11,Ted: It is freezing outside. Where is your jacket?
22267,75,4,11,Robin: I'm Canadian. No need to coat. This kind of weather does not scare me.
22268,75,4,11,"Marshall: It looks like a spring day in Minnesota, there was no q'il all the taxis, the skyscrapers and the blacks."
22269,75,4,11,Ted: There are no black people?
22270,75,4,11,Marshall: Not if Prince is on tour.
22271,75,4,11,GENERIC

22273,75,4,11,Lily: Go. It's not like that.
22274,75,4,11,"Ted: That's the history of Heather. It has been six years and three high schools for his baccalaureate. She took the opportunity to ruin two cars, being married for five days, and spent nine weeks in a tree only to find that no one intended to kill him. And there, Heather said she moved to New York."
22275,75,4,11,Lily: Great news.
22276,75,4,11,Ted: It will not come out. Remember when she talked of going to college here? And then the day of admission...

22278,75,4,11,"Ted is in the apartment, the phone."

22281,75,4,11,Ted: Nothing but the TV is 2000 balls.
22282,75,4,11,Woman: A last minute flight is expensive.
22283,75,4,11,Ted: Wait. Where are you?

22301,75,4,11,Ted's sister arrives and takes him in her arms.
22302,75,4,11,Heather: It's nice to see you.
22303,75,4,11,Ted: Hi kid. It looks to go. How are things at home?
22304,75,4,11,Heather: I took your room. Did you know you see the room of Miss Gottwald opposite?
22305,75,4,11,Ted: I know. She looks good?
22306,75,4,11,"Heather: Ted, it was 62 years."
22307,75,4,11,Ted: Answer.
22308,75,4,11,"Heather: Incredibly gay. (They return to the apartment) Dude, quail out there."
22309,75,4,11,"Barney: Why, hello. I was expecting you."
22310,75,4,11,Ted: One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself?
22311,75,4,11,Barney: I needed one that rotates.
22312,75,4,11,Barney gets up and makes a hand-kissing Heather.
22313,75,4,11,Ted: How did you know that Heather was coming?
22314,75,4,11,Lily: Do not tell me anything! You know I can not keep secrets if it's almost Christmas! Robin offers you an iPod!
22315,75,4,11,Barney: Can I talk to one second in the kitchen? Not touch the chair. I praise him. I can not believe that thou hast hid thy sister all these years.
22316,75,4,11,"Ted: Really? You're like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister."
22317,75,4,11,"Barney: First, I'm flattered. Then it's just jokes. A friend can joke on a friend's sister. Does not mean I'm going to act."
22318,75,4,11,"Ted: I love my sister, and as a big brother, it's my job to protect guys like you."
22319,75,4,11,Barney: You do not trust me?
22320,75,4,11,Ted: No. And it either.
22321,75,4,11,Barney: Okay. All right. I'll just... take my chair and leave.
22322,75,4,11,Ted: Wait... Rest... Back... Lily and I were dining out with Heather Sunday. Want to go?
22323,75,4,11,Barney: I have already called to add a person.
22324,75,4,11,Ted: You really can not tell Lily.
22325,75,4,11,"Barney: No, nothing really..."
22326,75,4,11,"Ted (2030): That year, Canada was really lacking in Aunt Robin, Marshall then brought him to where he was when he was nostalgic Minnesota: The bar of the Perche."
22327,75,4,11,Marshall and Robin arrive at the bar...
22328,75,4,11,Marshall: Hi everyone.
22329,75,4,11,All: Marshall!
22330,75,4,11,Marshall: This is Robin.
22331,75,4,11,All: Robin!
22332,75,4,11,Marshall: Turn drink.
22333,75,4,11,All: Drink!
22334,75,4,11,"Man: How are you, Marshall?"
22335,75,4,11,"Marshall: And you? Hey, man! You got anything in the leg?"
22336,75,4,11,Man: I played hockey today. I hurt my knee.
22337,75,4,11,Robin: You went to the hospital?
22338,75,4,11,Man: I poured beer on it. I miss the game of the Vikings.Minnesota!
22339,75,4,11,Robin: I love the guys here. This is real guys. Without shampoo or manicure. The guys from New York are 10% chick.
22340,75,4,11,Marshall: Go. You're wrong.
22341,75,4,11,"Lily, Barney and Ted are the sister restaurant."
22342,75,4,11,Barney: I'll take the vichyssoise with a hint of cream. Dairy ballonnent me.
22343,75,4,11,Heather: So... I found an apartment today.
22344,75,4,11,Ted: Really?
22345,75,4,11,"Heather: Yes. And I hoped you would have drunk a little more wine hand side before you to ask you this, but... I need you to lease the instructions."
22346,75,4,11,Ted: Let me think.
22347,75,4,11,"Barney: It, it means he will not."
22348,75,4,11,Heather: I really need your help.
22349,75,4,11,"Ted: We'll talk later, OK?"
22350,75,4,11,Barney: You do not have any illusions.
22351,75,4,11,Heather: What's the matter? You do not trust me?
22352,75,4,11,Ted: You're my sister.
22353,75,4,11,Barney: There he just says the obvious.
22354,75,4,11,"Heather: Listen, Ted, I want to get into finance, but... you see me like I was four and I wanted to become an astronaut."
22355,75,4,11,Ted: I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York.
22356,75,4,11,"Barney: Exactly. Do you need relationships. If only Ted knew someone who works at, say... Goliath National Bank, then...expect. What? I work for Goliath National Bank. Incredible!"
22357,75,4,11,Back at the bar of Marshall...
22358,75,4,11,Man: Okay. It's been two beers and Bemidji... who ordered the mini burgers?
22359,75,4,11,Robin: My God! This is Fisherman's Quest? I played all the time FQ at the time!
22360,75,4,11,"Marshall: Oh, yeah? I have the best score. Without boasting, I caught... a pike of almost 1 m. The biggest fish virtual nobody has ever taken. Finally... freshwater."
22361,75,4,11,Robin: I'll take my hat fisherman. Thank you for bringing me here. This is mine.
22362,75,4,11,"At the restaurant, Ted is still sitting when Lily puts her coat and Heather Barney helps to do the same."
22363,75,4,11,Ted: It's not a good idea. Heather and Barney alone in his office? And I do not want to be guarantor for the lease.
22364,75,4,11,"Lily: It ripens, just as you see it yet."
22365,75,4,11,"Ted: It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago."
22366,75,4,11,"Lily: Ted, many women have a period kleptomaniac. And yes, maybe sometimes they happen to mow a small object because it excites them in a strange way they are not explained. But... If it reassures you, I will accompany them to GNB, tomorrow. I will say that I'm going to lunch with Marshall, but in fact I espionnerai."
22367,75,4,11,Ted: It suits me. Good luck tomorrow at the GNB. I'm sure you will impress them.
22368,75,4,11,Lily: And I espionnerai. And sh1t!
22369,75,4,11,Lily and Marshall are still at the bar.
22370,75,4,11,"Robin: ""I drink to forget the 1999 NFC Championship""?"
22371,75,4,11,"Marshall: The match. The Vikings were 2 minutes to go to the Super Bowl, when our striker, who had not missed a year's messed up a penalty and we lost in overtime. Damn!"
22372,75,4,11,Male: 1999 NFC Championship Game?
22373,75,4,11,Marshall: Yes.
22374,75,4,11,Man: Damn!
22375,75,4,11,"Marshall: My father, I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear. He said... ""A small part of me just died, son. """
22376,75,4,11,Robin: I love the passion you have for your Vikings. It's like looking for hockey in Canada... What?
22377,75,4,11,Marshall: Do not let... anyone here know that you're not from Minnesota.
22378,75,4,11,Robin: Why? They will do anything q'ils learn that I am...
22379,75,4,11,"Man 1: It looks like a bar in Dallas, man?"
22380,75,4,11,"Male 2: It's weird, but is a reassuring side to be worn like that."
22381,75,4,11,"Man 3: Dude, did you see this guy! So, Robin, are you coming from?"
22382,75,4,11,"Robin: Bemidji. Bemidji, Minnesota. Go Vikes!"
22383,75,4,11,Ted is in the street with her sister Lily.
22384,75,4,11,"Ted (2030): Children, for the rest, I'll skip a few days."
22385,75,4,11,"Heather: Very nice, this briefcase."
22386,75,4,11,"Ted: Very friendly, the security camera, too. And there is one another. And a security guard."
22387,75,4,11,"Heather: I intend to pay it, Ted."
22388,75,4,11,"Ted: Yes. You got the job yet. Must push the door, not pull.And that's it. Thank you for having watched yesterday. Maybe I was wrong. She seems to have been able to manage with Barney. It will perhaps manage New York."
22389,75,4,11,Lily: Not enough!
22390,75,4,11,Ted: Why?
22391,75,4,11,Lily: I have a secret. No! It has not happened. It happened something.
22392,75,4,11,Ted: It's been what?
22393,75,4,11,"Lily: Nothing. After the interview Heather, I went to see Marshall one time, when I came back..."
22394,75,4,11,Flashback
22395,75,4,11,Lily enters the office of Barney when he gets dressed and Heather.
22396,75,4,11,Lily: My God!
22397,75,4,11,"Barney: Before you say or do something, give me a favor."
22398,75,4,11,Lily: What?
22399,75,4,11,Barney: Move away. It's a Prada.
22400,75,4,11,Barney picks up his shirt.
22401,75,4,11,End flashback
22402,75,4,11,Lily: I'm really sorry.
22403,75,4,11,Ted: I knew it. I've always known. It remained the same trail irresponsible. And when I see Barney...
22404,75,4,11,"Lily: You will say nothing. Ted, Heather begged me not to tell you. She hate me if she knows that I sneaked."
22405,75,4,11,"Heather: I love this kit, but I can not afford. You were right, Ted."
22406,75,4,11,Ted: And how!
22407,75,4,11,Lily: You see? She has not bought the briefcase! It is responsible! And no chance that she slept with someone here.She turns the page.
22408,75,4,11,Marshall returns to the bar...
22409,75,4,11,Marshall: Hi everyone!
22410,75,4,11,Robin: So my father and I were in the NFC championship game by 99.
22411,75,4,11,"Marshall: I said, good evening everyone!"
22412,75,4,11,Robin: And when we missed the penalty and lost...
22413,75,4,11,All: Holy sh1t!
22414,75,4,11,"Robin: Holy sh1t! f*cking. My father that I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear and said, ""A small part of me just died, son. """
22415,75,4,11,"Man: ""Son""?"
22416,75,4,11,"Robin: That's what I tell my son. If I am fortunate to have a son, I will call Rashad Tarkenton."
22417,75,4,11,Man: Nice story.
22418,75,4,11,Marshall: Beautiful story! But it seems a bit familiar.
22419,75,4,11,Robin: I know! They all bought into.
22420,75,4,11,Marshall: I see what you do.
22421,75,4,11,Robin: What?
22422,75,4,11,"Marshall: I've brought here because... I was sorry for you. And there, it looks like you're trying to steal my bar."
22423,75,4,11,Robin: You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host.
22424,75,4,11,"Man: ""Host""? Are you Canadian?"
22425,75,4,11,"Robin: No, I..."
22426,75,4,11,"Man: If you want to imitate a Canadian, just turn off the light and act as if you were afraid!"
22427,75,4,11,Robin: What was that?
22428,75,4,11,"Marshall: With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme."
22429,75,4,11,Robin: As fear of the dark?
22430,75,4,11,"Marshall: Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? ""What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! """
22431,75,4,11,Robin: This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?
22432,75,4,11,"Marshall: Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back."
22433,75,4,11,"Robin: No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians."
22434,75,4,11,"Marshall: Please, no scene."
22435,75,4,11,"Robin: Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!"

22437,75,4,11,Ted and his sister are in McClaren's with Lily and Barney.
22438,75,4,11,Barney: I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position.
22439,75,4,11,Lily: This is the new coasters?
22440,75,4,11,Barney: I hope you get the job. Nothing makes me happier than to fill an opening.
22441,75,4,11,"Lily: I swear, these coasters are thicker."
22442,75,4,11,Heather: I'm ready to bend over backwards.
22443,75,4,11,"Ted: OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!"
22444,75,4,11,Barney: You've sneaked?
22445,75,4,11,Lily: You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender.
22446,75,4,11,"Ted (holding Lily): And you, you're mature and responsible?It's responsible adult to go to your first interview in New York and banging a stranger? You've always been immature and irresponsible. You'll always be immature and irresponsible.And I cosignerai not a subscription with you, let alone a lease."
22447,75,4,11,"Heather: Barney and I, we did nothing."
22448,75,4,11,Ted: Come on. Lily saw you.

22452,75,4,11,"Barney: You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather..."
22453,75,4,11,Heather:... That we decided to show you what you expect from us.
22454,75,4,11,Barney: And as we can count on Lily to sneak.
22455,75,4,11,Lily enters the office.
22456,75,4,11,Lily: My God!
22457,75,4,11,End flashback
22458,75,4,11,Ted: What? Why do this?
22459,75,4,11,Heather: Because you deserve it.
22460,75,4,11,"Barney: Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe."
22461,75,4,11,"Heather: You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas."
22462,75,4,11,"Barney: Your mother and I, we kissed."
22463,75,4,11,Robin plays at Fisherman's Quest.
22464,75,4,11,Man 1: Continuous. You got five seconds to catch sturgeon still 2.
22465,75,4,11,Man 2: We will perhaps see the screen of the gills.
22466,75,4,11,Marshall: You can catch two fish with a hook.
22467,75,4,11,"Robin: No, but I can catch a fish and use this one to catch the other."
22468,75,4,11,Man 1: High Scores! You got beat Marshall!
22469,75,4,11,Marshall: It is Canadian! Robin is Canadian! She is Canadian.It comes not from Bemidji and she knows bugger all about the Vikings.
22470,75,4,11,Man 1: You're angry because she beat you.
22471,75,4,11,"Marshall: During the 1999 NFC Championship, when the Vikings lost..."
22472,75,4,11,All: Holy sh1t!
22473,75,4,11,Marshall:... who was the scorer who missed the penalty?
22474,75,4,11,Robin: Rashad Tarkenton.
22475,75,4,11,Marshall: Gary Anderson. He is retired. It was a case of fly fishing... in Canada.
22476,75,4,11,Man 1: Goodbye.
22477,75,4,11,"Robin: You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the ""Great White North""... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else."
22478,75,4,11,Robin leaves the bar.
22479,75,4,11,"At the apartment, Heather opens her bag and pulls out a briefcase."
22480,75,4,11,Ted: Merry Christmas. Look into it. If you push around the...Not down the middle.
22481,75,4,11,Heather: I do not need you.
22482,75,4,11,Ted: Got it.
22483,75,4,11,Heather: You've signed the lease.
22484,75,4,11,Ted: You know why?
22485,75,4,11,Heather: Because you trust me and that's a good idea?
22486,75,4,11,Ted: I want to know you. The new you.
22487,75,4,11,Heather: Thank you.
22488,75,4,11,"Ted: By the way, in your new neighborhood, you should put a good lock on your door. If you want... live."
22489,75,4,11,Robin is out to eat ice cream. Marshall joins.
22490,75,4,11,Marshall: Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything.
22491,75,4,11,"Robin: I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing."
22492,75,4,11,Marshall: But if.
22493,75,4,11,Robin: What?
22494,75,4,11,"Marshall: We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky."
22495,75,4,11,Robin: Thank you.
22496,75,4,11,Marshall: Yeah.
22497,75,4,11,Robin: I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada.
22498,75,4,11,Marshall: I was hoping that you say that.
22499,75,4,11,Marshall takes Robin to another bar.
22500,75,4,11,Robin: How did you find this place?
22501,75,4,11,"Marshall: Just like home, eh?"
22502,75,4,11,Robin: There's only one way to know.
22503,75,4,11,Robin shakes a man intentionally.
22504,75,4,11,Man: Sorry. I had not seen. Are you okay?
22505,75,4,11,Robin: It's OK.
22506,75,4,11,"Man: OK, I apologize. Take a donut, it's a gift."
22507,75,4,11,Robin: thank you.
22508,75,4,11,"Marshall: OK. You come home in him, he apologized and you file a donut free?"
22509,75,4,11,Robin: It's like home.
22510,75,4,11,The light goes out.
22511,75,4,11,Marshall: Sorry! All is well! Sorry.
22512,75,4,11,Robin: No one likes the dark.
22513,75,4,11,Man (speaking): The following comes from Ontario: Marshall Eriksen.
22514,75,4,11,Robin: You were a member? You sing what?
22515,75,4,11,"Marshall: I think you will recognize. I will throw your body anyway. I will throw your body into Canada Day! Dude, you can split the screen. We know the words."
22516,75,4,11,All: Everyone comes to play. Take all your worries. (Robin puts on a mask) Let's go to the mall. Today!
22517,76,4,12,"Ted (2030): Children in the winter of 2009, Robin and I became roommates. And to be honest it was not really the top."
22518,76,4,12,Robin eats on the couch when Ted leaves his room.
22519,76,4,12,Ted: It looks good. I'll do.
22520,76,4,12,Robin: There's no more milk.
22521,76,4,12,Ted: I saw in the fridge.
22522,76,4,12,Robin: empty.
22523,76,4,12,"Ted: So, throw it."
22524,76,4,12,Robin: The trash can is full.
22525,76,4,12,"Ted: So, take out the trash."
22526,76,4,12,Robin: I eat cereal.
22527,76,4,12,"Ted: You know, when I asked you to be my roommate, I said, ""A girl, she will be careful."" But no, you're an ogre Revenge of the Nerds."
22528,76,4,12,"Robin: You know what? Instead of coming with references typical last minute like that, you should spend some time, I dunno... washing a dish."
22529,76,4,12,"Ted: Damn, I can not. I'm busy leave a plate of cookies for the elf magic puts toilet paper. Wait, there's no elf. It's always me!"
22530,76,4,12,"Robin: I always changing. You, never!"
22531,76,4,12,Ted: This is ridiculous!
22532,76,4,12,"Robin: No, I went there yesterday... Stop it! Stop it! My God, what happens? When we were a couple, we lived together and we almost went insane."
22533,76,4,12,Ted: I know. It's been what?
22534,76,4,12,Robin: You know what this is? We made love. Men and women need s*x to live together. It resolves all disputes.
22535,76,4,12,Ted: As Barney's theory on world peace?
22536,76,4,12,Flashback
22537,76,4,12,Ted and Barney are at McClaren's.
22538,76,4,12,"Barney: I explained. I said, Madeline, every international conflict essentially boils down to sexual tension."
22539,76,4,12,Ted: All international conflicts?
22540,76,4,12,"Barney: All, man."
22541,76,4,12,"Ted: So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by..."
22542,76,4,12,Barney: Gaza Strippers. Next.
22543,76,4,12,Ted: Apartheid?
22544,76,4,12,"Barney: ""Apartouze"". You have what?"
22545,76,4,12,Ted: The Cold War?
22546,76,4,12,"Barney: ""Mrs. Gorbachev, removed her underwear."""
22547,76,4,12,End flashback
22548,76,4,12,"Ted: Well, I think we should love again."
22549,76,4,12,"Robin: Yes, of course."
22550,76,4,12,Ted and Robin are in bed.
22551,76,4,12,"Robin: I know. It's like riding a bike, man?"
22552,76,4,12,"Ted: Biking upside down. Well, listen. If it should happen on occasion, they say nothing to anyone. Sold."
22553,76,4,12,Robin: Sold.
22554,76,4,12,Marshall: Sold.
22555,76,4,12,GENERIC
22556,76,4,12,"Marshall: You do not care what, guys? You are back together?"
22557,76,4,12,Ted: No. It was just love to do more fighting.
22558,76,4,12,"Marshall: It's a great idea. No, really. Hat guys. I saw in the future and everything works perfectly for everyone."
22559,76,4,12,Robin: Why are you here anyway?
22560,76,4,12,Marshall: I was working and I had to take a leap here...reading this magazine. In... the room there.
22561,76,4,12,Ted: I understand. No problem.
22562,76,4,12,"Robin: If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door?"
22563,76,4,12,"Marshall: Well, Robin. Nobody likes reading a magazine at work. You leave your office holding a magazine..."
22564,76,4,12,Flashback
22565,76,4,12,Marshall is at work with a magazine in hand.
22566,76,4,12,Marshall:... and the magazine says one thing and no one.
22567,76,4,12,"Magazine: Hey everybody, look at what Marshall will do!Marshall will read an old magazine in the bathroom that you all share with him."
22568,76,4,12,End flashback
22569,76,4,12,Robin: Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine?
22570,76,4,12,Marshall: You have to read a magazine. That's why there has magazines.
22571,76,4,12,"Ted: So, this is wasted time."
22572,76,4,12,"Marshall: Exactly. And the worst part is, this piece of my hallway door to the toilet. It's exposure to criticism."
22573,76,4,12,Flashback
22574,76,4,12,Marshall: It was my head.
22575,76,4,12,Leader: We know exactly what you will do.
22576,76,4,12,Marshall: The boss.
22577,76,4,12,"Bilson: Eriksen, why you do not move your office there?"
22578,76,4,12,"Man: Donald ""I think he has a Woman."" My darling, if flagrant."
22579,76,4,12,End flashback
22580,76,4,12,"Marshall: Anyway, I'd rather do it here."
22581,76,4,12,"Robin: No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key."
22582,76,4,12,"Marshall: No, certainly not. Reminds me of a bargain between three parties where no one would discuss a certain event happened. An event... persuasion. This key, madam, this is my silence. Good day to you both."
22583,76,4,12,He left the apartment.
22584,76,4,12,"Barney, Robin, Ted, Marshall and Lily are in McClaren's."
22585,76,4,12,Lily: You slept together?
22586,76,4,12,"Marshall: Thank you, Lily."
22587,76,4,12,Marshall gives the key to Robin.
22588,76,4,12,"Barney: You... have slept together. What are épouv...stouflant. Epouvstouflant. Well done, Ted. Bravo."
22589,76,4,12,Robin: It seems more important than it is.
22590,76,4,12,Ted: We talked and we realized we had some difficult months.It deserves a little fun.
22591,76,4,12,"Lily: No. It could ruin your friendship. When two former try the ""right opportunity"", someone always ends in pain."
22592,76,4,12,"Ted (2030): In fact, Lily was right. We talk about it later."
22593,76,4,12,"Robin: We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules."
22594,76,4,12,Flashback
22595,76,4,12,Ted: Rule number one: purely physical relationship. There are no feelings.
22596,76,4,12,Robin: This is like telling Fonzie be cool.
22597,76,4,12,"Ted: And since it's just physical, it was not to worry love."
22598,76,4,12,Robin: You can do it watching TV!
22599,76,4,12,Ted: Absolutely! Let's multitasking. Use s*x to spice up the boring activities.
22600,76,4,12,Robin: As folding laundry.
22601,76,4,12,Ted: Paying the bills.
22602,76,4,12,Robin Cook.
22603,76,4,12,Ted: It's not very hygienic.
22604,76,4,12,"Robin: Yes, not that one."
22605,76,4,12,End flashback
22606,76,4,12,"Robin: And now they sleep together, we argue more."
22607,76,4,12,"Ted: Problem solved. In fact, the credit goes to Barney. This idea just your thing on the world peace."
22608,76,4,12,"Robin: Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once."
22609,76,4,12,"Barney: So, I am responsible for... Excellent. Excellent.Excellent. The next tour is for me!"
22610,76,4,12,It moves away from the table and Lily follows him.
22611,76,4,12,Lily: Are you okay?
22612,76,4,12,Barney: Yes. Why you ask?
22613,76,4,12,"Lily: For one thing, you cry openly."
22614,76,4,12,Barney: From joy. I am so happy for them.
22615,76,4,12,"Lily: Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you."
22616,76,4,12,"Barney: I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute. (He goes out into the alley behind the bar, takes a television in a trash can and throws it down. Then back to talk to Lily) I'm going quite well."
22617,76,4,12,Lily: You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.
22618,76,4,12,"Barney: Wait. If I pay a woman $ 200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe..."
22619,76,4,12,Lily: I entered.
22620,76,4,12,Ted: There's something liberating not to take it seriously.
22621,76,4,12,Robin: Last night we did when I answered the phone.
22622,76,4,12,Marshall: I knew you had not of paddler!
22623,76,4,12,"Barney: Wonderful, we still speak of that!"
22624,76,4,12,"Robin: Look, it's a private thing between me and Ted."
22625,76,4,12,Ted and Robin Trick private.
22626,76,4,12,Robin: It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work.
22627,76,4,12,"Lily: It was always like that. You remember, in law?"
22628,76,4,12,Marshall: Sure.
22629,76,4,12,Flashback
22630,76,4,12,"Lily is sitting on the couch, crying, when Marshall enters the apartment."
22631,76,4,12,Marshall: Baby? What has he?
22632,76,4,12,"Lily: The bank statement arrived today. You have booked a hotel two blocks from your school, a Tuesday."
22633,76,4,12,Marshall: That's not what you think.
22634,76,4,12,"Lily: It's that, Marshall? What's her name?"
22635,76,4,12,Marshall: Burrito. Carnitas Burrito.
22636,76,4,12,End flashback
22637,76,4,12,Robin: Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine?
22638,76,4,12,Marshall: You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.
22639,76,4,12,"Barney: Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine. "" But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, ""magazine is read"" is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, ""read a magazine"" that's wank, right?"
22640,76,4,12,Ted and Robin are back at the apartment.
22641,76,4,12,Ted: I think so. You still have drank all my milk!
22642,76,4,12,Robin: We can make love.
22643,76,4,12,Ted: OK.
22644,76,4,12,Ted is the bar with Barney.
22645,76,4,12,"Ted: This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing."
22646,76,4,12,Barney: Super.
22647,76,4,12,Barney is in the driveway and threw a television.
22648,76,4,12,"Ted: This morning, she cried through the door, ""You're too long in the shower! "". A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time."
22649,76,4,12,Barney: If great.
22650,76,4,12,"Again, he threw a television."
22651,76,4,12,"Ted: Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!"
22652,76,4,12,Barney: It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.
22653,76,4,12,He gets up and goes out into the aisle. It goes to get something in the trash but there is more.
22654,76,4,12,Barney is in an appliance store.
22655,76,4,12,"Barney: So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?"
22656,76,4,12,"Seller: Okay, but CRTs have the deepest blacks."
22657,76,4,12,Barney: So if I want a very good contrast ratio...
22658,76,4,12,Seller: The deep structure of the CRT pixel resolution produces unrivaled in LCD.
22659,76,4,12,Barney: I take the CRT.
22660,76,4,12,He is now behind the bar and throw again on TV. He enters the bar with a smile when Lily is waiting.
22661,76,4,12,"Lily: Barney, it's crazy."
22662,76,4,12,"Barney: I'm fine, thank you."
22663,76,4,12,"Lily: No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. ""The time for emotions"", every Tuesday morning."
22664,76,4,12,"Barney: Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better."
22665,76,4,12,
22666,76,4,12,Marshall is at his job.
22667,76,4,12,"Ted (2030): Meanwhile, Marshall always drooled at work."
22668,76,4,12,"Magazine: Listen all, big breakfast this morning. You know what that means."
22669,76,4,12,Ted (2030): Then came the best news he had heard long ago.
22670,76,4,12,Woman: Are you aware? They fired everyone in the eighth.
22671,76,4,12,Man: I know. This is a ghost town there.
22672,76,4,12,Marshall arrived at work one floor. He goes to the bathroom.
22673,76,4,12,Ted leaves his room while Robin is reading a magazine.
22674,76,4,12,Ted: Hello.
22675,76,4,12,Robin: Hello.
22676,76,4,12,Ted: It was fun last night.
22677,76,4,12,"Robin: Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often."
22678,76,4,12,"Ted: Okay, see you later."
22679,76,4,12,They kiss.
22680,76,4,12,Ted is in McClaren's with Marshall and Barney.
22681,76,4,12,"Ted: Last night, Robin left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had s*x three times."
22682,76,4,12,Marshall: OK.
22683,76,4,12,Ted: And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed.
22684,76,4,12,Marshall: Bizarre. It's weird.
22685,76,4,12,Ted: What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement. She probably thinks that I have feelings for her.
22686,76,4,12,Marshall: Do you have any?
22687,76,4,12,"Barney: Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man."
22688,76,4,12,Ted: No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.
22689,76,4,12,Barney: Clearly. This is the end.
22690,76,4,12,Marshall: Wait. Maybe she has not found it weird.
22691,76,4,12,Lily and Robin are in the apartment.
22692,76,4,12,"Robin: It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre."
22693,76,4,12,Lily: That's not how it is written.
22694,76,4,12,"Robin: Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted."
22695,76,4,12,"Lily: I warned you. When ex relapse, ultimately, it hurts someone. But nobody is listening. This is the story of my life.My nice face that prevents people listen to my message."
22696,76,4,12,Robin: What do I do?
22697,76,4,12,At the bar...
22698,76,4,12,"Barney: A single solution. You must stop sleeping together, please."
22699,76,4,12,At the apartment...
22700,76,4,12,"Robin: I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it."
22701,76,4,12,At the bar...
22702,76,4,12,Ted: I have to stop it.
22703,76,4,12,Ted and Robin are at the apartment and talk.
22704,76,4,12,"Robin: So, you stop that, huh?"
22705,76,4,12,Ted: I think so.
22706,76,4,12,"Robin: This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird."
22707,76,4,12,Ted: I do not either.
22708,76,4,12,Robin: Colocs?
22709,76,4,12,Ted: Colocs.
22710,76,4,12,Ted opens the fridge and took the empty bottle of milk. Ted and Robin are in bed.
22711,76,4,12,Ted: But they say nothing to anyone. Okay?
22712,76,4,12,Robin: Sold.
22713,76,4,12,Marshall: Sold.
22714,76,4,12,Robin: Dude!
22715,76,4,12,Ted: Seriously!
22716,76,4,12,At the bar...
22717,76,4,12,Lily: What is your problem?
22718,76,4,12,Barney (the appliance store): This one.
22719,76,4,12,He throws it down.
22720,76,4,12,Ted: It did not last long.
22721,76,4,12,"Robin: Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan."
22722,76,4,12,Marshall: That was the case.
22723,76,4,12,Flashback
22724,76,4,12,Marshall eats with others of his job.
22725,76,4,12,"Marshall: Everything was going well. I felt more and more comfortable, more confident. I could conquer the world. One morning I'm in the eighth with a magazine."
22726,76,4,12,He enters the bathroom and two workers arrived.
22727,76,4,12,"Man 1: We will demolish everything. I want that you will destroy these walls, here... and there."
22728,76,4,12,Male 2: It works.
22729,76,4,12,The first man goes and takes a second mass.
22730,76,4,12,Marshall: The celebrities extend their clothes? I also extend my machine. (The man breaks the wall of the toilet where Marshall is located) Do not enter!
22731,76,4,12,End flashback
22732,76,4,12,Marshall: It did not last long.
22733,76,4,12,"Barney takes out the trash, when Ted returns."
22734,76,4,12,Barney: Thank you.
22735,76,4,12,Ted: What are you doing?
22736,76,4,12,"Barney: Because of your bickering roommates are always a source of conflict between you two, I wanted to help. In fact, I went to the post. I took you stamps. In about 10 000. That should be enough."
22737,76,4,12,"Ted: Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?"
22738,76,4,12,Ted opens the fridge full.
22739,76,4,12,Barney: I took it in passing. It's nothing.
22740,76,4,12,Ted: You have bought us a dishwasher?
22741,76,4,12,Barney: It has always been there. You've been here how long?
22742,76,4,12,"Ted: So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?"
22743,76,4,12,Barney: Exactly. I worry about you.
22744,76,4,12,"Ted: It bothers you that we sleep together, right?"
22745,76,4,12,Barney: Not at all. It's crazy. What?
22746,76,4,12,Ted: You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.
22747,76,4,12,Barney: What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?
22748,76,4,12,Ted: Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.
22749,76,4,12,Barney: I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus.
22750,76,4,12,Ted: That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?
22751,76,4,12,"Barney: No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls."
22752,76,4,12,Ted: Are you sure?
22753,76,4,12,Barney: Yes!
22754,76,4,12,Ted: Positive?
22755,76,4,12,Barney: Absolutely. (Barney out of the apartment)
22756,76,4,12,Barney is in the class of Lily.
22757,76,4,12,"Barney: And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke."
22758,76,4,12,Lily: Get out of here.
22759,76,4,12,"Barney: But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division."
22760,76,4,12,"Lily: Barney, you're not at your therapist. These children also have their problems, you know. Ben's parents divorced."
22761,76,4,12,Ben: Really?
22762,76,4,12,Lily: Who wants to do the coloring?
22763,76,4,12,Barney is now in his office. Between Marshall.
22764,76,4,12,"Barney: Great, it's Lily who sent you? I have not the bear, OK?I will make it! Why are you smiling?"
22765,76,4,12,Marshall: I just... reading a magazine. Here at work.
22766,76,4,12,Barney: What?
22767,76,4,12,"Marshall: It's the funniest thing. I was on the net, looking at hotels when I realized something."
22768,76,4,12,Flashback
22769,76,4,12,Marshall is on his computer.
22770,76,4,12,Marshall: This is stupid.
22771,76,4,12,End flashback
22772,76,4,12,"Marshall: I decided it was time to face my complex and do what I had to do and once that decision, everything changed."
22773,76,4,12,Flashback
22774,76,4,12,Marshall walks in the hallway with a magazine and coffee in hand.
22775,76,4,12,Woman: That's a young man at ease in his sneakers.
22776,76,4,12,Man: I know what you are about to do and I respect you for that.
22777,76,4,12,Bilson: Well the road.
22778,76,4,12,"Magazine: You have taken a big step today. Remember Shakespeare: ""Virtue is fearless and goodness, without fear."""
22779,76,4,12,"Marshall: You're right, Super Babe Are My Woman Stop telling me Why You Are Not Famous But I stop To forget. Let's do it."
22780,76,4,12,Magazine: Watch the road.
22781,76,4,12,End flashback
22782,76,4,12,Barney: Congratulations.
22783,76,4,12,Marshall: Thank you. I would have done well at some point.Sometimes you have to... You have to say and... go there.
22784,76,4,12,"Barney: Marshall, I gotta go. In fact, there are toilets here, if you want to use."
22785,76,4,12,Barney out of his office.
22786,76,4,12,Marshall:... Species
22787,76,4,12,Barney arrives at Ted's apartment.
22788,76,4,12,"Barney: Ted, I must tell you the truth. I love... (Robin out the trash) tacos. What are you doing?"
22789,76,4,12,"Robin: I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way."
22790,76,4,12,Barney: Really? That's Wife... vantable.
22791,76,4,12,Robin: Epousvantable?
22792,76,4,12,"Barney: Yes, it is épousvantable. What has happened?"
22793,76,4,12,"Robin: He insisted. He said ""no longer able to do"" if ""it hurt someone."" I think we all know who he is talking about."
22794,76,4,12,Barney: Oh?
22795,76,4,12,Robin: It's not obvious?
22796,76,4,12,Barney: It is?
22797,76,4,12,Robin: Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of...
22798,76,4,12,Barney: I love you.
22799,76,4,12,"Robin: Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?"
22800,76,4,12,Barney: A Taco?
22801,76,4,12,"Robin: You love them, right?"
22802,76,4,12,Barney: Just.
22803,76,4,12,"Robin: Come on, I'm hungry."
22804,76,4,12,In McClaren's...
22805,76,4,12,"Ted (2030): So Robin and I have again become roommates and everything is back to normal. Your Aunt Lily was right.When two former try the ""right opportunity"", someone is always hurt. It was just not one of us."
22806,77,4,13,"March 1998, Lily Marshall waits at the airport."
22807,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): Children, during the second year of college, when Lily is back from vacation, Marshall surprised her at the airport.And she caught him with a pack of Root Beer."
22808,77,4,13,Lily: Fort Lau-ger-Dale! Get it?
22809,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): And suddenly, a ritual was born. The next 11 years, if one of them was on a plane..."
22810,77,4,13,"June 2002, Lily Marshall waits at the airport."
22811,77,4,13,Marshall: Minne-Cider! Get it?
22812,77,4,13,Ted (2030):... the reunion was still commemorated with a sign and a pack where they came from.
22813,77,4,13,February 2008...
22814,77,4,13,Lily: Aspen Yards Ale! Get it?
22815,77,4,13,"Marshall: Actually, no!"
22816,77,4,13,Lily: I do not either. I was hoping that you find.
22817,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): But, one night in January 2009, the unthinkable happened."
22818,77,4,13,"January 2009, Ted and Marshall are in McClaren's."
22819,77,4,13,Marshall: I will not get it.
22820,77,4,13,Ted: What?
22821,77,4,13,Marshall: Lily not want me to take a taxi to the airport just to get a taxi in the opposite direction.
22822,77,4,13,Ted: But the thing of the pack?
22823,77,4,13,"Marshall: It was fun when we were younger, but we exceeded it. When mature, the relationship matures with us."
22824,77,4,13,"Ted: But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world."
22825,77,4,13,"Barney: There are two students out, and they look easy!"
22826,77,4,13,Ted and Barney runs out of the bar.
22827,77,4,13,Ted: Arizona... You know... I always wanted to see what looks like a license in Arizona.
22828,77,4,13,Barney: I already did that. 21 years.
22829,77,4,13,Ted: It's good. God thank you. What brings you here?
22830,77,4,13,Woman 1: Our group did a concert.
22831,77,4,13,Ted: You have a group? We will perhaps see you.
22832,77,4,13,Barney: Excuse me one second. (Barney leads Ted to the bar entrance) What is your problem? We will not see them play.
22833,77,4,13,Ted: Why?
22834,77,4,13,"Barney: If you go see them, it is not better than blondes showing their tits at a concert by Van Halen."
22835,77,4,13,"Ted: Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?"
22836,77,4,13,"Barney: If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required."
22837,77,4,13,Ted: We are their fathers?
22838,77,4,13,"Barney: Exactly. (They go see the girls) This is a great meeting, I think that we can come. Another time, girls."
22839,77,4,13,"Ted: If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers."
22840,77,4,13,Barney: Excuse us a minute. (Barney leads Ted still at the entrance of the bar) Have you gone crazy? We do not want their numbers.
22841,77,4,13,Ted: I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.
22842,77,4,13,"Barney: Qua na you exchange a number, you give him the opportunity to call to cancel. If you give a number without an appointment, they must come. Checkmate! No number, just my fingers. Truck."
22843,77,4,13,Ted: You're still their father?
22844,77,4,13,They go back again.
22845,77,4,13,Barney: Why not arrange to meet you here tomorrow night to 22h.
22846,77,4,13,Woman 1: I think it will snow. What do we do if there is a blizzard?
22847,77,4,13,"Barney: Whatever happens, we will be there."
22848,77,4,13,"Ted: That's all ""ski"" account."
22849,77,4,13,Barney: Sorry one last time.
22850,77,4,13,Ted: What is the problem here?
22851,77,4,13,Barney: Well done.
22852,77,4,13,Ted: Thank you.
22853,77,4,13,Barney: At tomorrow night.
22854,77,4,13,Woman 2: Bluntly.
22855,77,4,13,Woman 1: Great!
22856,77,4,13,The two women leave.
22857,77,4,13,"Barney: 'Definitely. Great! ""Dude, these students seem stupid."
22858,77,4,13,Ted: Bluntly.
22859,77,4,13,"Barney: Awesome. Here's the thing: tomorrow night, dress up well, it will move!"
22860,77,4,13,Ted: We would still have had to make their numbers.
22861,77,4,13,"Barney: You always imagine the worst. Ted, I promise, everything will be okay. It begins to snow."
22862,77,4,13,GENERIC
22863,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): Children, the blizzard of 2009 was a monster. It snowed for 3 days, which gave three incredible stories. I start with Barney and me."
22864,77,4,13,Ted and Barney are the only McClaren's.
22865,77,4,13,Ted: It's really bad outside. They will not.
22866,77,4,13,"Barney: But if it will come. It has to. If I can touch one of those girls, I get a ""Bingo party student."" Come on, Ted. You're the only one here."
22867,77,4,13,"Ted: Sorry, a ""Bingo party student""?"
22868,77,4,13,"Barney: Every year, Playboy publishes a list of the best student parties in the country. I take the top 25, and I do... a bingo card. All I need now that Arizona Tech, which is crazy. In a contest, it would be given automatically."
22869,77,4,13,Ted: How many people are on this festive bingo student?
22870,77,4,13,Barney: Just me.
22871,77,4,13,Ted: What is the purpose then?
22872,77,4,13,Barney: The goal is to make it five in a row.
22873,77,4,13,"Ted: And you got what, if you succeed?"
22874,77,4,13,Barney: I have a bingo.
22875,77,4,13,"Marshall repaired the radiator to Ted's apartment, in front of Robin."
22876,77,4,13,Robin: Thanks for stopping by. I hacked the thermostat for 1 h before it was seen that the intercom.
22877,77,4,13,"Marshall: Yeah, I heard you moan from below."
22878,77,4,13,"Robin: The theft of Lily's tonight, you're really not looking for it?"
22879,77,4,13,"Marshall: As I said, when you grow up, our relationship matures with us."
22880,77,4,13,"Robin: Knowing your wife, she'll still bring you back a pack."
22881,77,4,13,Marshall imagines the scene. Lily arrives at the airport and can not find Marshall.
22882,77,4,13,Lily: Marshall?
22883,77,4,13,Man: Puget Stout. The choicest of beverages from Seattle.And speaking of pack...
22884,77,4,13,He lifts his shirt and Lily goes with him.
22885,77,4,13,Robin: What are you doing?
22886,77,4,13,Marshall: I'm going to the airport. How could I be so stupid? Of course it takes me back a pack!
22887,77,4,13,Lily is on the plane.
22888,77,4,13,"Lily: But this time, I'm not back pack. Because... when it matures, the relationship matures with us."
22889,77,4,13,Woman: He looks like a nice young man. I bet it will surprise you and pick you up anyway.
22890,77,4,13,"Lily also imagines the scene. She arrives at the airport without pack, and Marshall awaits."
22891,77,4,13,Marshall: Where is my beer?
22892,77,4,13,Lily: It was said not this time.
22893,77,4,13,"Marshall turns his sign which says: ""Someone with beer."""
22894,77,4,13,Woman: I have beer.
22895,77,4,13,"Marshall: A pack and a size that suits me. Come on, new Lily."
22896,77,4,13,Marshall leaves with the woman and leaves Lily.
22897,77,4,13,Lily: I drink beer.
22898,77,4,13,"Voice: This is your captain speaking. Apparently, it will arrive with an hour early."
22899,77,4,13,Ted and Barney are still at the bar alone.
22900,77,4,13,"Carl: Finish, guys. I close the bar."
22901,77,4,13,Ted: No! It is only 21h.
22902,77,4,13,"Barney: And it rocks here, yo!"
22903,77,4,13,"Carl: I'm really sorry, but I have to install beds in the church. It becomes a refuge, snowy nights."
22904,77,4,13,Barney: selfish b*st*rd! There are two cannons girls who come to us here.
22905,77,4,13,Ted: You can leave it open a little more? We monitor everything.
22906,77,4,13,Carl: You two? Impossible. You ignore the low bar.
22907,77,4,13,Barney: Serve the guns first?
22908,77,4,13,"Carl: That's the key. Once your girls arrive, you turn off the lights and close. I want to go back and find a mess here."
22909,77,4,13,Ted: Seriously?
22910,77,4,13,Carl: I can trust you.
22911,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): To find out what it meant to have the keys to the bar, I must revert back to the night when I released five little words that everyone says at one point in his life."
22912,77,4,13,Flashback
22913,77,4,13,Barney and Ted are playing Monopoly.
22914,77,4,13,Ted: There should be a bar.
22915,77,4,13,"Barney: Of course, we should have a bar!"
22916,77,4,13,Ted: You really should have a bar.
22917,77,4,13,Barney: It really should have a bar.
22918,77,4,13,Ted: Our bar would be great.
22919,77,4,13,"Barney: And dude, dude, dude, dude... The name of our bar will be... Puzzles. People will, ""Why Puzzles? ""That's the puzzle."
22920,77,4,13,"Ted: That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap."
22921,77,4,13,Barney: No nightcap!
22922,77,4,13,"Ted: Except where everyone ended up spending the best night of his life, then we put the chairs on the tables and pulled out the margarita fountain."
22923,77,4,13,Barney: There should be a bar.
22924,77,4,13,Ted: There should be a bar.
22925,77,4,13,Ted (2030): Like all stupid sentences of five words that every man in her life said...
22926,77,4,13,Marshall is on the edge of the roof.
22927,77,4,13,Marshall: I can jump as far.
22928,77,4,13,At the apartment...
22929,77,4,13,Ted: I'm going to recover.
22930,77,4,13,At the bar...
22931,77,4,13,Carl: I can trust you.

22937,77,4,13,Woman: I'm Rachel Sondheimer.
22938,77,4,13,"Ranjit: One moment, Lily. IF you get off the plane, which is Marshall? And the pack of beer?"
22939,77,4,13,Lily: That's the problem. I must be Brunivers in East Meadow in one hour.
22940,77,4,13,Ranjit: In the car!
22941,77,4,13,Lily: Thank you.
22942,77,4,13,"Ranjit hand with Lily, leaving Rachel plan."

22948,77,4,13,Barney: Served.
22949,77,4,13,Ted: We will buy one.
22950,77,4,13,"Woman 1: thank you God, you're still here."
22951,77,4,13,"Woman 2: I do not know if you've seen Star Wars, but it looks like Hoth out."
22952,77,4,13,Ted: Prem's.
22953,77,4,13,Woman 1: Reminds me of when I was sledding with my father... before he leaves.
22954,77,4,13,Barney: And prem's.
22955,77,4,13,Ted: It can get warm with a glass?
22956,77,4,13,"Woman 2: Sure... In fact, I invited the rest of the group to join us."
22957,77,4,13,Woman 1: It is the intention of getting drunk. Really get drunk.As my father did.
22958,77,4,13,"Barney: Prem's, prem's prem's."
22959,77,4,13,"Ted: I guess you could stay open longer. As it is you and the group? (The bar is crowded) Melissa, what kind of group is it?"
22960,77,4,13,Melissa: We are the band of hens fighting Arizona Tech.
22961,77,4,13,"All: Come on, Chickens!"
22962,77,4,13,Ted (2030): It was then that Uncle Barney and I had a telepathic conversation.
22963,77,4,13,"Ted: Dude, Carl is going to kill us if we turn not everyone immediately. I'm serious. He promised not to mess. Okay, you score a point. The bar is open! Who wants a beer?"
22964,77,4,13,Robin and Marshall drive to the airport.
22965,77,4,13,"Robin: I always find it silly. What happened to ""when you grow up, the relationship matures with us""?"
22966,77,4,13,"Marshall: It's just something Lily read in ""Psychology."" It's good, she read in ""Cosmo"". Okay, I read in ""Cosmo"". Well, it was in ""Cosmo Girl"". Drive, OK?"
22967,77,4,13,Robin: Why make a fuss a little ritual is abandoned.
22968,77,4,13,"Marshall: It's more than that, OK? This is our little rituals. You know what we did when I got home?"
22969,77,4,13,Robin: I do not wanna hear about f*ck like rabbits.
22970,77,4,13,Marshall: They told what they had eaten at noon.

22985,77,4,13,"Lily: No, I love you even more."
22986,77,4,13,"Marshall: Do we get a room to pull all this out? It seemed like a good compromise, although I have to work my positions. I love you too."

22999,77,4,13,"Robin: All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette."
23000,77,4,13,Marshall: Maybe you think it's stupid because you've never had a relationship that lasts long enough for that.
23001,77,4,13,Robin: What?
23002,77,4,13,"Marshall: You know nothing of love. You're like a robot that someone would cry and say that... ""Why this human leaking?"""
23003,77,4,13,Robin: Really? Okay... Robot mode station-you-on-the-aisle-in-waiting-for-excuse-of-the imbecile.
23004,77,4,13,Robin stops on the roadside.
23005,77,4,13,Marshall: My robot was... a thousand times better.
23006,77,4,13,"Ted and Barney are always at McClaren's, behind the counter."
23007,77,4,13,"Man: FYI, the sink overflows into the bathroom."
23008,77,4,13,Ted: There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.
23009,77,4,13,Barney: Is there anything in a gin and tonic? There's what in a gin and tonic?
23010,77,4,13,"Ted: Hold a bar, it sucks. Is closed."
23011,77,4,13,"Barney: No nightcap! (The phone rings) Puzzles, Barney here."
23012,77,4,13,"Carl: Well, you're still there. I arrive in 5 minutes."
23013,77,4,13,Barney: Last glass.
23014,77,4,13,Robin and Marshall are always stopping on the roadside.
23015,77,4,13,Marshall: A snowplow arrives. We must leave.
23016,77,4,13,"Robin: You think being in love, it's just to have pet names. Or let the words stupid or darken in the blizzard for no reason."
23017,77,4,13,Marshall: You know what will happen?
23018,77,4,13,"Robin: You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club ""Snob love."""
23019,77,4,13,"Marshall: We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen."
23020,77,4,13,Robin: Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go. (The snowplow passes and buried under the snow) It's been what?
23021,77,4,13,Ranjit and Lily arrive at a store.
23022,77,4,13,Lily: It was earlier called for the drink of Seattle.
23023,77,4,13,"Man: You did well to call. I was close. It's the perfect storm outside. It was only in 2009, when the storm of the century, it is perhaps a little premature. Let the storm of the year. Even if one is in January."
23024,77,4,13,"Lily: It is rather a hurry, so we'll take the beer."
23025,77,4,13,Man: You are a cute couple.
23026,77,4,13,Ranjit: Thank you.
23027,77,4,13,Lily: We're not a couple.
23028,77,4,13,"Man: God thank you. It would have been weird. Here it is.""Supersonic Tonic""."
23029,77,4,13,Lily: No. It is a drum. I want a six pack.
23030,77,4,13,Man: That's all I have.
23031,77,4,13,Lily: You take the barrel.
23032,77,4,13,"Ranjit: What? No. The last time I had one in the car, I ended up removing the dried vomit on the seat with a knife."
23033,77,4,13,"Lily: Sorry, Ranjit, but it is a ritual, and I back this beer. If you could put it in the car. I'll give you $ 50."
23034,77,4,13,Ranjit: A car.
23035,77,4,13,Robin in the car...
23036,77,4,13,"Marshall: Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules."
23037,77,4,13,Robin: Close your eyes.
23038,77,4,13,"Marshall: I know not how you thought I draguais you, but..."
23039,77,4,13,"Robin: Do it. (Robin opened the roof and the snow falls on them) Now, go find your wife."
23040,77,4,13,Barney makes people out of the bar.
23041,77,4,13,"Barney: Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me."
23042,77,4,13,"Man: One day, we should have a bar. And when it will, there will never be nightcap."
23043,77,4,13,Ted: We said no last drink. We must do.
23044,77,4,13,Barney: We should do what? Carl will be there from one moment to another.
23045,77,4,13,Ted: We can do one thing.
23046,77,4,13,Ted was a bar to his apartment.
23047,77,4,13,"Ted: Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know."
23048,77,4,13,Barney: We should start a band.
23049,77,4,13,Ted: Of course! Why was not yet formed a band?
23050,77,4,13,Marshall and Robin arrive at the airport.
23051,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): Children, sometimes in life, the planets align, everything comes together, and your timing is perfect.(Marshall and Lily calls Marshall called Lily but neither Marshall or Lily of the horizon. Lily sits on a bench and Marshall as well) It was not one of those moments."
23052,77,4,13,Marshall: Where is she?
23053,77,4,13,Robin: Seattle.
23054,77,4,13,Marshall: What?
23055,77,4,13,Robin: His flight was canceled. He has never taken off.
23056,77,4,13,Marshall: She would have called me and...
23057,77,4,13,Marshall looks at his phone. Lily is in Seattle.
23058,77,4,13,"Lily: Baby, it's me. My flight was canceled because of a snowstorm and I will not fly until Thursday, I'm still stuck here for two days. It's lunchtime and I love you."
23059,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): As I said, it was a storm of three days. Tuesday..."
23060,77,4,13,Robin and Marshall are by car.
23061,77,4,13,Robin: I still think it's stupid.
23062,77,4,13,"Ted (2030): Wednesday... (Barney and Ted are at McClaren's, behind the counter) And Thursday... (Lily is a store with Ranjit) So Tuesday, when Marshall heard this message..."
23063,77,4,13,"Marshall: It not return until Thursday. It was all the way here and not return until Thursday. I feel stupid. Listen, they say nothing to Lily about everything, OK? Especially the part where thou dredges."
23064,77,4,13,Robin: I've not dredged.
23065,77,4,13,Marshall: That's it.
23066,77,4,13,Ted (2030): Then Wednesday...
23067,77,4,13,"At the apartment, it's party time."
23068,77,4,13,"Ted: Dude, I do not believe that you've ever done this far.You'll have to go back and redo all that way again tomorrow."
23069,77,4,13,Marshall: The whole thing was a sign. Let us end this ancient ritual. I will not get it.
23070,77,4,13,Ted: Robin you really dredged?
23071,77,4,13,"Marshall: Dude, that was weird."
23072,77,4,13,"Man: Guys, this festival is great! You are true friends of Hens fighting. If necessary, do not hesitate to ask."
23073,77,4,13,Barney: The flute section does she see anyone?
23074,77,4,13,Ted: You're not really looking for it?
23075,77,4,13,Marshall: Really.
23076,77,4,13,"Ted: So, on New Year's kiss, calls for lunch, all... ""I ate it today,"" you're really going to drop it?"
23077,77,4,13,"Marshall: Yes, really."
23078,77,4,13,Ted (2030): Which brings us to Thursday.
23079,77,4,13,"Lily is sitting on a bench at the airport. 3 men playing music, then a band come in, revealing Marshall."
23080,77,4,13,"Marshall: A muffin, a pastrami sandwich, and chips. I know that lunch is over, but I love you. I love you Lily, more and more each day. Happy New Year. That means I have to bring a band at the airport now?"
23081,77,4,13,Lily: Yes.
23082,77,4,13,Marshall: Damn.
23083,77,4,13,"Marching band, Go Hens!"
23084,77,4,13,Ted is sitting on the couch with a woman.
23085,77,4,13,Ted: Puzzles.
23086,77,4,13,Woman: This is a great band name. Have you seen Amanda?
23087,77,4,13,Barney: Bingo!
23088,78,4,14,"Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney and Ted read letters."
23089,78,4,14,Marshall: It's crazy that Metro News One sends you this letter now.
23090,78,4,14,"Robin: Yes, I went for 4 months."
23091,78,4,14,Lily: You got more fans than I thought.
23092,78,4,14,Ted: And only 60% of them are prisoners.
23093,78,4,14,"Robin: These guys think what? I am far from my phase ""dating a prisoner."" It's like: ""Hi, I am over 19 years."""
23094,78,4,14,Barney: The daughter of the lottery is there.
23095,78,4,14,Robin: I'm sorry for these women. This is where careers go to die on TV.
23096,78,4,14,Barney: Look. It's funny. I invented a little game
23097,78,4,14,Presenter: The lotto numbers tonight are... 19...
23098,78,4,14,"Barney: Your age on arrival in New York after a photographer you have ""discovered"" to be published in Vogue."
23099,78,4,14,Presenter: 53...
23100,78,4,14,Barney: The number of nude photos that he has done before you realize he had no connection to Vogue.
23101,78,4,14,Presenter: 22...
23102,78,4,14,Barney: The age that you say you have.
23103,78,4,14,Presenter: 31...
23104,78,4,14,Barney: Your real age.
23105,78,4,14,Presenter: 45...
23106,78,4,14,"Barney: The number of minutes for me to put in a taxi, get undressed and into my Jacuzzi."
23107,78,4,14,Presenter: And the super bowl tonight is...
23108,78,4,14,Barney: What happens after that is out of the jacuzzi. Great?
23109,78,4,14,GENERIC
23110,78,4,14,"Ted (2030): Children in the winter of 2009, Robin was unemployed for months. But there was a glimmer of hope."
23111,78,4,14,Robin joined the others at McClaren's.
23112,78,4,14,Robin: Hi.
23113,78,4,14,Lily: How was the audition?
23114,78,4,14,Robin: I went very confident. I knew it was just me against two other girls.
23115,78,4,14,Barney: I listening.
23116,78,4,14,Flashback
23117,78,4,14,"Robin is in a waiting room, sitting between two women."
23118,78,4,14,Robin: Hello.
23119,78,4,14,Woman 1: Hello.
23120,78,4,14,Robin: Robin Scherbatsky. And you are?
23121,78,4,14,"Woman 1: You have obviously never been to Denver.Rochelle Harper, News Center 12. It was just the first string for the Rockies... 5 years on."
23122,78,4,14,Robin: I was a presenter here for Metro News One.
23123,78,4,14,Rochelle: Presenter. You must have a mirror finish.
23124,78,4,14,Robin: Sorry?
23125,78,4,14,"Woman 2: You must have a mirror finish. Like Walker Cronkite: ""And that's how it is."""
23126,78,4,14,Rochelle: What is yours?
23127,78,4,14,"Robin: I always ended up with a simple ""all of us at Metro News One, have a great evening."""

23129,78,4,14,"Barney: Mine: ""From all of us in Barney's apartment, get out."""
23130,78,4,14,"Lily: You do not let these bitches destabilize you, right?"
23131,78,4,14,Flashback
23132,78,4,14,Robin this information.
23133,78,4,14,"Robin:... and the president's economic team hopes to have a proposal before Congress by the end of the month. All of us at News 10, have a great evening. So, good night, New York.And that the road ahead is illuminated in dreams and tomorrows. Which are lit with dreams... also."
23134,78,4,14,End flashback
23135,78,4,14,Ted: It's terrible. And bad... also.
23136,78,4,14,Robin: It's not over.
23137,78,4,14,Flashback
23138,78,4,14,"Robin: Arise, New York. Trust. Recycle. Exit covered."
23139,78,4,14,End flashback
23140,78,4,14,Marshall: Leave covered?
23141,78,4,14,"Robin: I will not be a presenter at Channel 10, right?"
23142,78,4,14,Barney: It just fell.
23143,78,4,14,They are back to the apartment to read the letters.
23144,78,4,14,Ted: The problem may be your CV. Have you seen like mine is ventilated? Yours is too busy.
23145,78,4,14,"Robin: As if everything on your resume is so important?""Program Director, Radio Wesleyan University""?"
23146,78,4,14,Marshall: My God.
23147,78,4,14,Lily: Dr. X? You always talk to Dr. X?
23148,78,4,14,Robin: Who is Dr. X?
23149,78,4,14,Ted: No one knows. It was a mysterious and awesome DJ.
23150,78,4,14,Marshall: It was Ted.
23151,78,4,14,Ted: His identity is still secret.
23152,78,4,14,Lily: It was Ted.
23153,78,4,14,Ted: But this phantom waves changed the face of the campus radio.
23154,78,4,14,Marshall: It was Ted.
23155,78,4,14,Lily: The show was zero.
23156,78,4,14,Flashback
23157,78,4,14,"In 1998, Marshall and Lily listen to the radio."
23158,78,4,14,"Radio: Here Dr. X, bullets of truth from an undisclosed location. For if I knew where they would silence me."
23159,78,4,14,"Marshall: You're the 3rd floor of the home student next to the playroom, dork."
23160,78,4,14,Radio: I received lots of letters for my story on the menus of racist school.
23161,78,4,14,"Lily: How do you receive mail if someone knows where you are, moron?"
23162,78,4,14,"Radio: This is why I organize an event to the self, Monday at midnight. It is time that leaders of the canteen remove ignorance and injustice menus. (Someone from the person of the radio) Ted, we are missing a player. What are you doing here, anyway? Dude, get out of here! I'll be right. Remember, self, Monday, midnight. Another event Dr. X. I'll be there, because X leaves its mark..."
23163,78,4,14,End flashback
23164,78,4,14,"Marshall: If you think people liked your show, it's wrong..."
23165,78,4,14,Barney: Bizarre. Look at what is mixed with your fan mail.
23166,78,4,14,Robin: What?
23167,78,4,14,Barney: It comes from the Ministry of Immigration.
23168,78,4,14,Robin: The postmark date of two months. My God.
23169,78,4,14,Lily: What has he?
23170,78,4,14,"Robin: My work permit. If I can not find a job in the coming...seven days, they will refer me to Canada."
23171,78,4,14,Barney: I can not believe you that turns the country.
23172,78,4,14,Robin: I know. My whole life is here.
23173,78,4,14,Ted: No. We will not let them. One of us will help you find.
23174,78,4,14,"Lily: Yes, I'm sure I can find you something at school."
23175,78,4,14,"Marshall: No, guys... it does not work like that. Robin will have its license if it works in his field. You could stay if you got married to a U.S. citizen. Yes, it might work. No. The procedure to formalize it would take too much time. It will not work."
23176,78,4,14,Robin: I'm screwed. I send my demo for 3 months and nothing.
23177,78,4,14,"Ted: Maybe there is something in it that people do not like.We'll watch it, OK?"
23178,78,4,14,Ted puts the tape.
23179,78,4,14,"Robin: Good question, Norm. For the first, I was an intern for Channel 22 in Red Deer. Alberta. In Canada. The snow falls hard enough, but these intrepid fishermen are still happy to contribute to the gathering of bass fishing Lake Athabasca, a tradition of 1 August To you, Norm. What? It was my first job. It shows where I come from."
23180,78,4,14,"Barney: Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo."
23181,78,4,14,"Marshall: No, no, I understand. Your origins are part of what you sell. Moreover, in 'Special jurisdiction' on my resume, I put that in Minnesota, I was dunk champion Nicollet County in 1995."
23182,78,4,14,Ted: You've put champion dunk in your CV?
23183,78,4,14,"Marshall: Yes, why not? Many companies have a basketball team. They like that TonnerreVanille can still crash into the net."
23184,78,4,14,Robin: We called you TonnerreVanille?
23185,78,4,14,"Marshall: Yeah, TonnerreVanille. The ghost of snowshoes.The gate man. I was not very good in defense."
23186,78,4,14,Ted: You can dunk more.
23187,78,4,14,"Marshall: Bine sure if. Finally, I could... until there is little."
23188,78,4,14,Lily: Until the injury.
23189,78,4,14,Flashback
23190,78,4,14,Lily and Marshall are at the doctor.
23191,78,4,14,Doctor: It's tendonitis of the iliopsoas.
23192,78,4,14,"Lily: Wow, it's scary."
23193,78,4,14,Doctor: More commonly known as the dancer's hip.
23194,78,4,14,Lily and the doctor laugh.
23195,78,4,14,Marshall: Go! Iliopsoas tendinitis. This is the name. This is the only name.
23196,78,4,14,End flashback
23197,78,4,14,"Marshall: iliopsoas tendinitis. It's a basketball injury. Finally, nothing incredible."
23198,78,4,14,"Lily: The dancer's hip, Marshall's ax dancer."
23199,78,4,14,"Marshall: OK, no. They call it like that because it is very common among ballet dancers."
23200,78,4,14,"Robin: Tell me, other girls in your class have the dancer's hip?"
23201,78,4,14,Marshall: Sure.
23202,78,4,14,Ted: I have a technical question. Is it easier to dance when you do not have external genitalia?
23203,78,4,14,"Marshall: Well, go ahead, feel free to me."
23204,78,4,14,"Lily: Come on, guys. It did not hurt while dancing."
23205,78,4,14,"Marshall: Thank you, Lily."
23206,78,4,14,"Lily: Obviously, the stirrups were too far apart during his last visit to the gynecologist."
23207,78,4,14,"Barney: Folks, sorry to stop you before Marshall falls into tears, but Robin, check it out. What you need is a super video resume. Like mine. I present to you: Barneysvideocv.com.(The video starts with an explosion) Hello. Barney Stinson, you have achieved great successes in business, sport and personal relationships, and have been an inspiration to many people."
23208,78,4,14,Ted: Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?
23209,78,4,14,Barney: How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential?
23210,78,4,14,Ted: And a little Scottish.
23211,78,4,14,"Barney: The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset."
23212,78,4,14,Ted: You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?
23213,78,4,14,"Barney: And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit."
23214,78,4,14,Marshall: You know you stand next to a horse. Impressive.
23215,78,4,14,"Lily: Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips."
23216,78,4,14,"Barney: Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon."
23217,78,4,14,Marshall: Really?
23218,78,4,14,"Barney: No, it would be... You listen? All my life I have dared to go beyond the possible. Until the impossible? In fact, beyond that... where the possible and the impossible meet to become... the possimpossible."
23219,78,4,14,Lily: The possimpossible? Oh yeah?
23220,78,4,14,"Barney: Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision...""Visia-ness."" If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible. (Several assembly passes with a song) This guy is awesome."
23221,78,4,14,Ted: It's you again...? You sing a song about you?
23222,78,4,14,"Barney: Absolutely not. It would be stupid. Stinson, Barney Stinson singing this song, it would be really stupid. One of the fans who think this guy is awesome. Perfect and available.Great, Great, Great, Great, Great, Great... Great, great. Barney Stinson, committed. This jewel has earned me 11 jobs."
23223,78,4,14,Ted: Impossible.
23224,78,4,14,"Lily: Barney, it was ridiculous and foolish."
23225,78,4,14,Marshall: insensate-ule.
23226,78,4,14,Robin: Make me one.
23227,78,4,14,Lily: What?
23228,78,4,14,"Barney: Now, we talk about it."
23229,78,4,14,Robin: What? I will be deported. I would try anything.
23230,78,4,14,"Barney: OK, we should get started. I have much to shoot, I can not use the tapes I have of you."
23231,78,4,14,Robin: Bands on me?
23232,78,4,14,Barney: Let's start.
23233,78,4,14,Lily and Marshall are both at the bar.
23234,78,4,14,Lily: Honey. You're always sorry for the joke of the dancer?They joked. We all know that this is a basketball injury.
23235,78,4,14,"Marshall: Yes, absolutely. I have something to say."
23236,78,4,14,Lily: What?
23237,78,4,14,Marshall: I dance more than you think.
23238,78,4,14,Lily: What?
23239,78,4,14,Marshall: I dance... more than you think.

23241,78,4,14,"Barney did his apartment a TV studio, where Robin is presenter."
23242,78,4,14,Barney: What does it mean to be a reporter for you?
23243,78,4,14,Robin: Since I was little...
23244,78,4,14,"Barney: Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""dynamism"". You can invent a word, as... ""Relationality."""
23245,78,4,14,Robin: How does make me feel stupid commit somewhere?
23246,78,4,14,"Barney: All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky."
23247,78,4,14,Robin: Rotate the camera. Connectitude.

23256,78,4,14,Marshall: I know. I think... I would say... average.
23257,78,4,14,"Lily: Why do you dance much, and I do not know why?"
23258,78,4,14,"Marshall: I do that when I'm alone. When something good happens, and I'm excited and move, and I... I dunno, I want to talk about it."
23259,78,4,14,Lily: You hurt the hip like that?

23269,78,4,14,Robin: What? But you do anything in your video. You were right next to a horse and sitting on a motorcycle.
23270,78,4,14,Barney: I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong.
23271,78,4,14,Robin: I can not break 15 bricks with my forehead.
23272,78,4,14,"Barney: There is more in 1950. Yes, you can."
23273,78,4,14,Robin: I'm off.
23274,78,4,14,Barney: Why?

23283,78,4,14,Man 1: Wait.
23284,78,4,14,Man 2: Why she says like that? It's as if she did not care so that the 17. She looks nasty.
23285,78,4,14,"Man 1: Yes, she looks super wicked. You can repeat ""17"" for us?"
23286,78,4,14,Robin: 17.
23287,78,4,14,Man 2: I even understand what it does.
23288,78,4,14,Man 1: Let me try something. Try to be a little disillusioned.
23289,78,4,14,Robin: Disillusioned? On the 17th?
23290,78,4,14,Man 1: Disillusioned with a small...

23298,78,4,14,Ted: As a vaginal rejuvenation?
23299,78,4,14,Marshall: You know who has not made a lot of vaginas in college?
23300,78,4,14,Ted: Who?
23301,78,4,14,Marshall: Dr. X.
23302,78,4,14,Ted: It was perfect!

23304,78,4,14,Ted: Marshall and I are the only ones here with sh1t on our resume?
23305,78,4,14,Lily: What are you insinuating?
23306,78,4,14,"Marshall: I know! Does July 4, 1995 does remind you of anything?"

23320,78,4,14,At the apartment...
23321,78,4,14,Lily: I think so.
23322,78,4,14,Robin: I remember the night before. They made me a farewell party. They gave me a camera to take pictures and send them home. Everyone was sure I will have much success. You will really miss.

23328,78,4,14,Barney: I've finished your video resume myself. I posted it to all channels of the city. A guy called from Channel 8. He adores you. He wants you to pass an audition.
23329,78,4,14,Robin: My God!
23330,78,4,14,Barney: I said no. Robin Scherbatsky do not audition. He is given the job or anything.
23331,78,4,14,"Robin: So, I have the job."
23332,78,4,14,"Barney: No. He cursed me and hung up. But after Channel 12, called. They'll love it too. They offer you to host their new talk show in the morning."
23333,78,4,14,Robin: It's amazing!
23334,78,4,14,Barney: I sent them sh1t.
23335,78,4,14,Robin: Dude!
23336,78,4,14,Barney: They want you even more. So they increased their offer by 10%. Congratulations. Looks like you'll have to stay.
23337,78,4,14,Lily: You're not going to dance?
23338,78,4,14,Marshall: It's OK. Later.
23339,78,4,14,Robin: How did you do that?

23353,79,4,15,Lily: Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type?
23354,79,4,15,"Barney: Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going."
23355,79,4,15,Lily: You noticed that Barney is weird lately?
23356,79,4,15,"Ted: Actually, yes. You know, he never gives flowers to a girl, because living things remind babies?"
23357,79,4,15,Lily: Yes.
23358,79,4,15,"Ted: The other day I saw him in a flower shop on the 82nd, he bought roses."

23368,79,4,15,Lily: Wait. Where are you going?
23369,79,4,15,Barney: Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere.
23370,79,4,15,Barney leaves the bar.
23371,79,4,15,Lily: My God. He goes to see now.
23372,79,4,15,Everyone ran from the bar to catch Barney.
23373,79,4,15,They are all in a taxi and follow Barney.

23386,79,4,15,Barney: Mom!
23387,79,4,15,Lily: So that's what we hide you? You did not want people to know that you're a momma's boy.
23388,79,4,15,"Barney: Yes, you got me. I guess you can leave."
23389,79,4,15,A woman walks down the stairs.

23403,79,4,15,"Robin: What's that, Barney?"
23404,79,4,15,"Barney: It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price."

23406,79,4,15,Marshall: Bob Barker is your father.

23418,79,4,15,"Barney: And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep ""Betty"" and make a casting to find my son, Tyler."
23419,79,4,15,Lily: It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?
23420,79,4,15,"Barney: For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition."

23431,79,4,15,Grant: Yes?
23432,79,4,15,"Barney: You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s."
23433,79,4,15,Lily and Marshall go down the stairs.
23434,79,4,15,Lily: It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.
23435,79,4,15,Marshall: It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.
23436,79,4,15,"Barney: Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat."

23438,79,4,15,"Barney: No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily."
23439,79,4,15,"Ted: I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!"

23441,79,4,15,Ted: Yes.
23442,79,4,15,"Betty: Thank you. I know not, finally, the purpose of Brecht's work is of course..."
23443,79,4,15,Ted and Betty:... to confuse people.
23444,79,4,15,Ted: Yes. Sorry. You got a Brechtophile before thee!
23445,79,4,15,Betty: You know it really theater.

23456,79,4,15,Grant: At least one person who still loves to play. I miss that.
23457,79,4,15,Robin: You do not like playing the son of Barney?
23458,79,4,15,Grant: I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call.
23459,79,4,15,"Robin: I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years."
23460,79,4,15,"Grant: Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose."
23461,79,4,15,Robin: I have not had surgery.
23462,79,4,15,Grant: That's it. Neither do I.
23463,79,4,15,Marshall and Lily are in the kitchen with the mother of Barney.
23464,79,4,15,Lily: I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?
23465,79,4,15,"Loretta: Thank you, darling. Actually, I was not so perfect a mother when I was younger."
23466,79,4,15,Marshall: Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.
23467,79,4,15,"Loretta: Yeah, I was rather a drag."
23468,79,4,15,Lily: I'm sorry?
23469,79,4,15,"Loretta: A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, ""I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet. "" Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive."
23470,79,4,15,Marshall: Barney Mom? Loretta.
23471,79,4,15,"Loretta: Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect."
23472,79,4,15,Marshall and Lily talk to Barney.
23473,79,4,15,"Marshall: You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better."
23474,79,4,15,"Barney: No, no question. The truth would kill her."
23475,79,4,15,"Marshall: I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?"
23476,79,4,15,"Lily: Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, ""Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. """
23477,79,4,15,Marshall: She was joking.
23478,79,4,15,"Lily: She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget."
23479,79,4,15,Marshall: You're going to say what?
23480,79,4,15,Lily: Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?
23481,79,4,15,"Barney: On the bed ""race car""?"
23482,79,4,15,"Marshall: The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it."
23483,79,4,15,Lily: Really? I hate your mother.
23484,79,4,15,Marshall: You know what? I hate you!
23485,79,4,15,Marshall goes upstairs.
23486,79,4,15,"Loretta: In two minutes, meat loaf!"
23487,79,4,15,Tyler: Meatloaf? Tyler to love!
23488,79,4,15,Barney: We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!
23489,79,4,15,Grant: But it's funny.
23490,79,4,15,Barney: I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.

23500,79,4,15,"Betty: So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe?"
23501,79,4,15,"Lily: No, not at all."
23502,79,4,15,Loretta: And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?
23503,79,4,15,"Barney: Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?"
23504,79,4,15,Tyler: Well...
23505,79,4,15,Barney: Page 4...
23506,79,4,15,Tyler: The dinosaur bones at the museum have come back to life and chasing me?

23513,79,4,15,Barney: No weak link in this scene. Bravo!
23514,79,4,15,"Robin: Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs."
23515,79,4,15,Marshall: You can stop with that?
23516,79,4,15,Barney: Go and eat your ice.
23517,79,4,15,Grant: I can not. I'm lactose intolerant.
23518,79,4,15,Barney: Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite.
23519,79,4,15,Loretta: It's time for ice!

23545,79,4,15,He slaps him again.
23546,79,4,15,"Ted: Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!"
23547,79,4,15,"Barney: Mom, you leave us a moment?"
23548,79,4,15,Loretta: There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows.
23549,79,4,15,She leaves the kitchen and Marshall closes the door.
23550,79,4,15,Barney: You've lost your mind?
23551,79,4,15,Betty: You were amazing! You really become that character.
23552,79,4,15,"Ted: Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him."
23553,79,4,15,She kisses Ted.
23554,79,4,15,Barney: What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?
23555,79,4,15,Lily: It may be time to tell him the truth.
23556,79,4,15,"Marshall: I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m!"
23557,79,4,15,Robin is out with Tyler.
23558,79,4,15,Grant: How were my tears?

23568,79,4,15,"Barney: Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over."
23569,79,4,15,Loretta: My God!
23570,79,4,15,Barney: None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.
23571,79,4,15,Loretta: What?
23572,79,4,15,"Barney: I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom."

23580,79,4,15,"Barney: I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me?"
23581,79,4,15,"Loretta: I'm confused. I do not know why you thought having to do that. I love you, perfect family or not. I love you, no matter what."
23582,79,4,15,Barney: Really?
23583,79,4,15,Loretta: Really.
23584,79,4,15,"Barney: I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you."
23585,79,4,15,Loretta: Whatever. I love you always.
23586,79,4,15,"Barney: Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do."
23587,79,4,15,"Loretta: When you were 3 years old, I left you with a babysitter and spent three weeks with Grand Funk Railroad, from one guy to another like a bang."
23588,79,4,15,Barney: Mom!

23594,79,4,15,Ted (2030): Thus ended one of the strangest afternoons of our lives.
23595,79,4,15,"Lily: And I just wanted to say, if I was never cold or distant, I'm sorry."

23597,79,4,15,Marshall: My mother.
23598,79,4,15,Lily: It mean a lot to me if we could be closer.

23607,79,4,15,"Marshall, Lily, Barney, Robin and Ted are in McClaren's."
23608,79,4,15,"Marshall: That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?"
23609,79,4,15,Barney: Nope!
23610,79,4,15,Ted: Who do you like in Die Hard?
23611,79,4,15,"Barney: Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character."
23612,79,4,15,"Lily: OK, and Breakfast Club?"
23613,79,4,15,Barney: The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit.
23614,79,4,15,Robin: I have one. Terminator.
23615,79,4,15,"Barney: What is the title, Robin? Who among us has not shed a tear when his small red eye goes to the end and he can not kill these people? Sorry. The film..."
23616,79,4,15,Ted: I'll watch the film again with you.
23617,79,4,15,Barney: They even try to help!
23618,80,4,16,"Ted (2030): In 2009, your Aunt Robin had a morning show.She had to get up early enough. At what point?"
23619,80,4,16,"1:45, Robin joined Barney, Ted, Marshall and Lily to McClaren's."
23620,80,4,16,"Robin: Hello, everyone."
23621,80,4,16,Marshall: So you do really? You really gonna go to work at 2am.
23622,80,4,16,Robin: I do not for me. I do it for the fans.
23623,80,4,16,Marshall: Who is a fan of a program broadcast at 4am?
23624,80,4,16,Lily: Those with a show at 5am?
23625,80,4,16,Ted: The addicts who have not sold their TV?
23626,80,4,16,Barney: The strippers in this weird time between work and waking the children?
23627,80,4,16,Robin: They are. Put me know. It's been what?
23628,80,4,16,"Marshall: You know, as usual."
23629,80,4,16,"Barney: Really, as usual.? Think the funniest thing that ever happened."
23630,80,4,16,Robin: It's good.
23631,80,4,16,Barney: And twice that.
23632,80,4,16,Robin: So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?
23633,80,4,16,Barney: Something even funnier happened to Marshall today.
23634,80,4,16,"Marshall: First, nothing is funnier than that. Then it's not such a good story."
23635,80,4,16,"Robin: Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me?"
23636,80,4,16,Lily: What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue.
23637,80,4,16,Barney: I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl.
23638,80,4,16,"Ted: My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine."
23639,80,4,16,Lily: Karen is here?
23640,80,4,16,Barney: You're kidding me!
23641,80,4,16,"Ted (2030): Children, I think you talked about Karen."
23642,80,4,16,Flashback
23643,80,4,16,"Ted (2030): It was my girlfriend in high school and at times in college. She was beautiful, intelligent. I was crazy in love with her. The only problem, Marshall and Lily were not. It should probably come out of this as soon as we opened."
23644,80,4,16,"Ted is on his bed, kissing a girl while Lily and Marshall are playing cards."
23645,80,4,16,Karen: I like you live in a dorm. It's so American. Like eating rotten sandwiches and be racist.
23646,80,4,16,End flashback
23647,80,4,16,"Lily: My God, it was a real idiot."
23648,80,4,16,"Marshall: Dude, the gold medal of the andouille de Vire."
23649,80,4,16,Ted: It was not that bad.
23650,80,4,16,"Lily: Of course, for you. You had it turned into a zombie of andouille."
23651,80,4,16,"Marshall: I want to eat your brain, but only if it is organic and free range."
23652,80,4,16,Ted: What?
23653,80,4,16,Flashback
23654,80,4,16,"Marshall, Lily, Ted and Karen eat in the room of Ted and Marshall."
23655,80,4,16,Lily: You pass me the salt?
23656,80,4,16,Karen: The salt? It's so bourgeois.
23657,80,4,16,Ted: Bluntly.
23658,80,4,16,"Marshall is lying on his bed, wearing Ted and Karen's books next."
23659,80,4,16,Karen: What is this?
23660,80,4,16,Marshall: It's... a TV.
23661,80,4,16,Karen: I not watch TV.
23662,80,4,16,Ted: Bluntly.
23663,80,4,16,Karen: You thought I would buy tickets to WrestleMania? It was ironic.
23664,80,4,16,Ted: Bluntly.
23665,80,4,16,Marshall (disguised): I know... you was ironic. Me too... I'm ironic.
23666,80,4,16,Lily (arriving disguised): Let's go! What?
23667,80,4,16,End flashback
23668,80,4,16,Marshall: This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid.
23669,80,4,16,"Barney: So far. Tells the story, tells the story!"
23670,80,4,16,Marshall: Get off me!
23671,80,4,16,Robin: Wait. It's really funny?
23672,80,4,16,"Barney: I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny."
23673,80,4,16,Marshall: Okay.

23675,80,4,16,Marshall is in the locker room with his colleagues.
23676,80,4,16,Marshall: This morning I was in the gymnasium of the box to play basketball. The guys from work can be quite violent with their taunts.
23677,80,4,16,Bilson: Look Wisniewski. He will cry. Look at him.
23678,80,4,16,Man: Look at him.
23679,80,4,16,Marshall: I think that the knees are made to bend like that. He may have torn his cruciate ligament.
23680,80,4,16,"Bilson: Dude, all that he has torn, that's her uterus or maybe her hymen."
23681,80,4,16,"Man: Yeah, or the fallopian tube."

23696,80,4,16,GENERIC
23697,80,4,16,"Robin: He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey."
23698,80,4,16,"Ted: So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no?"
23699,80,4,16,Lily: You can not get back with Karen.
23700,80,4,16,Ted: I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called?
23701,80,4,16,"Marshall: It is not the worst, no. That would be the fourth worst.1: Super volcano. 2: An asteroid falls to Earth. 3: Any record of Evel Knievel is lost. 4: Ted called Karen. 5: Lily is eaten by a shark."
23702,80,4,16,"Lily: My name is Lily and I approve this order. You know the story. Ted and Karen had a rocky relationship in college. It always happened like this. They were having fun, being obnoxious until one day..."

23706,80,4,16,"Man: Sorry, dude."

23729,80,4,16,"Ted: I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Marshall has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool."
23730,80,4,16,Marshall: I regret it at all.
23731,80,4,16,Ted: So you really think that I should not call?

23738,80,4,16,Ted: Because I will not invite him to lunch... again.
23739,80,4,16,Lily: You have to lunch?

23800,80,4,16,Ted: It was great. There was an odd moment near the end.
23801,80,4,16,"Robin: How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal."
23802,80,4,16,Barney: And a hug is like a hug in public.
23803,80,4,16,Marshall: You must embrace strangely.
23804,80,4,16,Lily: What has happened?
23805,80,4,16,Ted: So...

23812,80,4,16,Marshall: You can not change the subject like that.
23813,80,4,16,Robin: The pants.
23814,80,4,16,Barney: The pants! The pants!
23815,80,4,16,"Marshall: It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily."
23816,80,4,16,"Barney: Tell us, what was this concern?"
23817,80,4,16,Marshall: I forgot my pants.
23818,80,4,16,Flashback
23819,80,4,16,"At school, Lily is on the phone."

23827,80,4,16,Lily: That's nothing compared to this crazy thing with Karen.Ends.
23828,80,4,16,Ted: That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.
23829,80,4,16,"Lily: Why do you say ""the restaurant""? You've embraced elsewhere?"
23830,80,4,16,"Ted: As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?"
23831,80,4,16,Marshall: You did what?
23832,80,4,16,Flashback

23835,80,4,16,Barney: How could you?
23836,80,4,16,"Lily: Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table."
23837,80,4,16,"Ted: Lily, let's be honest. We know both your motives. You hate Karen because she lingered."
23838,80,4,16,Lily: Asshole.
23839,80,4,16,Robin: What do you mean by linger?

23844,80,4,16,End flashback
23845,80,4,16,"Lily: Ted Horn, critique my painting, anything, that's your business. But I catch you eyeing the mess of my guy and you lingered? You'll be received well."
23846,80,4,16,Robin: The game is the game
23847,80,4,16,"Marshall: In his defense, I had just the muscle."
23848,80,4,16,Ted: Why paint naked?
23849,80,4,16,"Lily: He had eaten my fruit bowl. The fact is that Karen is a dirty pervert, you can not bring into our lives."
23850,80,4,16,"Ted: Relax, it was just one night! And three after. And one morning. But at least I had pants. Even if, in fact, I had not."
23851,80,4,16,Robin: It happened to us? Where was I?
23852,80,4,16,Ted: You know the sleeping pills you take for your crazy schedule? They are stronger than you think.

And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?"
23862,80,4,16,Robin: What is the result with the bimbo?
23863,80,4,16,"Marshall: It's a foregone conclusion. Ted is Charlie Brown trying to shoot and Karen, it's Lucy who takes away the ball at the last second and sleeping with. You have understood me.Ted falls in love, and Karen is going wrong with a playboy, who says... ""Sorry, dude."""
23864,80,4,16,"Ted: False! You got to let the right answer in your pants, because that's exactly what did not happen."

23876,80,4,16,Robin: You really do speak of your pants?
23877,80,4,16,Marshall: What?

23892,80,4,16,Barney: What about you?
23893,80,4,16,"Lily: Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one."
23894,80,4,16,"Barney: He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has."

23910,80,4,16,Marshall: What has happened to Karen?
23911,80,4,16,"Lily: I'll finish for you. Ted left without saying anything, and Karen got exactly what she wanted."

23917,80,4,16,"Ted: You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all."
23918,80,4,16,"Karen: OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel."
23919,80,4,16,Ted: We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.
23920,80,4,16,"Karen: Ted, wait. In fact, ""good bye"" means ""until we see each other again."" So I guess you mean that in fact, we'll meet again?"

23926,80,4,16,"Lily: You know, this is perhaps good that you called Karen."
23927,80,4,16,"Ted: Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me."
23928,80,4,16,"Ted (2030): You see, children, sometimes when you have to have a difficult discussion, the better to do..."
23929,80,4,16,Lily: Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?
23930,80,4,16,"Ted: Right. On this subject... After breaking up with this guy, we went out, we slept since we're together. It's really okay, this time it's different. Here it is. Be nice!"

23934,81,4,17,All: Hi.
23935,81,4,17,"Ted: Sorry, can not stay."

23938,81,4,17,Karen: They are real diamonds?
23939,81,4,17,"Robin: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you."

23947,81,4,17,Marshall: I put the forms there.
23948,81,4,17,"Ted: Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide."

23953,81,4,17,Lily: That's because he met her in high school. This is his first girlfriend.
23954,81,4,17,"Marshall: For us, Karen is an idiot. For him, this is the first to have touched his pen1s in hand himself, his mother and pediatrician."
23955,81,4,17,Robin: It's almost 2am. I must work.
23956,81,4,17,"Lily: How can they call it a ""daily""? 4h, it's still the middle of the night. You impressed me."
23957,81,4,17,"Robin: It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right?"
23958,81,4,17,Marshall: That is clear.
23959,81,4,17,Barney: I've never seen.
23960,81,4,17,Robin: You've ever watched?

23967,81,4,17,Marshall: Sorry.
23968,81,4,17,Barney: I just said.
23969,81,4,17,"Robin: I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look."
23970,81,4,17,"Marshall: You know what? This Friday, everyone will come home at 3:30. We leave the pajamas and watch his show."
23971,81,4,17,Robin: You're the best.
23972,81,4,17,Lily: We want to encourage you.
23973,81,4,17,"Friday, 3:30, Marshall, Lily and Barney are in the lounge."
23974,81,4,17,Lily: I just want to sleep!

23990,81,4,17,Karen: Have you slept with Robin?
23991,81,4,17,Ted: What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.
23992,81,4,17,Karen: Why I believe you?

24021,81,4,17,"Barney: Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, ""Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? ""It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, ""Held danger of Ninja,"" if you want. You stay still a transvestite."
24022,81,4,17,Marshall: I do not care. It's comfortable.
24023,81,4,17,"Barney: Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work."
24024,81,4,17,"Ted: I know. I live with Marshall for 12 years. Every time I put something, it's a victory."
24025,81,4,17,Ted folds his clothes in the room.
24026,81,4,17,"Lily: Ted, it will start!"
24027,81,4,17,Ted: I arrive.
24028,81,4,17,Ted is an earring on Robin bedroom dresser.
24029,81,4,17,The show starts Robin.
24030,81,4,17,"Robin: Hello, New York. I'm Robin..."
24031,81,4,17,Ted mutes.
24032,81,4,17,"Ted: Marshall, I found an earring Robin on your dresser. You know why the other was in my bed?"
24033,81,4,17,Marshall: What are you talking?
24034,81,4,17,Ted: You hate Karen. You told me to break it. It's you. Did you put the loop in my bed for Karen to find.
24035,81,4,17,Marshall: I would never...
24036,81,4,17,Ted: Admit it!
24037,81,4,17,Marshall: There's nothing to admit!
24038,81,4,17,Ted: Why was it on your dresser?
24039,81,4,17,Barney: It is pretty!
24040,81,4,17,"Ted: I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field..."
24041,81,4,17,Lily: Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break.
24042,81,4,17,Ted: You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?
24043,81,4,17,Lily: I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch.
24044,81,4,17,Ted: What is this test?
24045,81,4,17,"Lily: You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together. (Lily imagines the scene) When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day."
24046,81,4,17,"Marshall, Lily and Ted are on the porch of a house and play cards."
24047,81,4,17,"Lily, old: Bridges are wild. A bridge of four beats a royal bridge."
24048,81,4,17,"Ted, old: I see your bridges and I raise of 3 bridges."
24049,81,4,17,"Marshall, old: Bridge! I won!"
24050,81,4,17,"Barney: You know not to play bridge, eh?"
24051,81,4,17,Lily: It will take over.
24052,81,4,17,Marshall: It's important to stay active.
24053,81,4,17,"Lily: So whenever you go out with someone for a while, I take the test of the porch. How that person will fit over the years?And when I think of Karen..."
24054,81,4,17,"Marshall, old: Bridge! I won!"
24055,81,4,17,"Karen, old: Fantastic. Yet the bridge. Especially, not reading."
24056,81,4,17,"Ted, old: Look, darling... dolphins."
24057,81,4,17,"Karen, old: They seem happy. Apparently, the chemical releases of this property have not yet elitist rotten their vents. It will happen. This water will kill you. A real trap toxic."
24058,81,4,17,"Lily, old: I'm going swimming."
24059,81,4,17,"Marshall, old: I'm coming with you."
24060,81,4,17,Lily: Karen has failed the test of the porch. She had to leave.
24061,81,4,17,Ted: I can not believe you did that.
24062,81,4,17,"Lily: Do you like is great, you, me and Marshall. Really, think about it."
24063,81,4,17,Ted: It's pretty awesome.
24064,81,4,17,"Lily: It is really great! So for that you will marry, one that will join the Team Géniale, the bar is very high. I say that I did well, but..."
24065,81,4,17,Marshall: You're better off without her.
24066,81,4,17,"Barney: If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be."
24067,81,4,17,"Marshall: You know what? Go ahead, laugh."
24068,81,4,17,Barney: Why are you wearing this stuff?
24069,81,4,17,Marshall: Several reasons.
24070,81,4,17,Barney: You can not even give five.
24071,81,4,17,Marshall: A: You can not wear anything underneath.
24072,81,4,17,Ted: I confirm. You can cross your legs?
24073,81,4,17,Marshall: Two: It's sexy.
24074,81,4,17,Lily: I confirm. You can uncross your legs?
24075,81,4,17,"Marshall: Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?"
24076,81,4,17,Barney: I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.
24077,81,4,17,Lily: So you're really angry?
24078,81,4,17,"Ted: I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better."
24079,81,4,17,"Lily: I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave."
24080,81,4,17,"Ted: ""Redo""? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?"
24081,81,4,17,Lily: Never! Six.
24082,81,4,17,Ted: Like who?
24083,81,4,17,"Lily: No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so..."
24084,81,4,17,Flashback
24085,81,4,17,
24086,81,4,17,A woman sleeps.
24087,81,4,17,Lily:... one day she was taking a nap...
24088,81,4,17,"Lily-between opens the door and on the CD is a convenient but then wants to see someone come out, she goes and hides in the closet. Ted's turn to the room and discovered the CD."
24089,81,4,17,"Ted: Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her."
24090,81,4,17,He leaves and Lily out of the closet.
24091,81,4,17,End flashback
24092,81,4,17,Marshall: That's where is my CD of Creed.
24093,81,4,17,Ted: Who else?
24094,81,4,17,"Lily: Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so..."
24095,81,4,17,Flashback
24096,81,4,17,"Ted is in a queue in disguise. A person, also disguised, comes to see."
24097,81,4,17,"Woman: Look, Ted, you're great, and it is very difficult, but I think it does not look the same. So, long life and prosperity. Or something else."
24098,81,4,17,End flashback
24099,81,4,17,Ted: That was you? It's crazy!
24100,81,4,17,"Lily: Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you."
24101,81,4,17,Ted: And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?
24102,81,4,17,"Lily: If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella."
24103,81,4,17,Ted: Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too?
24104,81,4,17,"Lily: Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know: you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive."
24105,81,4,17,Ted: You have made us break up?
24106,81,4,17,"Lily: You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children."
24107,81,4,17,Ted: You have made us break up?
24108,81,4,17,Lily: I did what I had to do.
24109,81,4,17,Ted: You have made us break up?
24110,81,4,17,Lily: Just as I did!
24111,81,4,17,Barney by nightdress: Your grandfather was a wise Olaf.
24112,81,4,17,Ted: You made me break with Robin?
24113,81,4,17,"Lily: No, it's not..."
24114,81,4,17,Ted: I can not believe it. I need another drink.
24115,81,4,17,Barney: I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.
24116,81,4,17,Marshall: You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.
24117,81,4,17,"Barney: The Little Barney says ""Mahalo."""
24118,81,4,17,"Ted: Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?"
24119,81,4,17,Lily: I did it because I care about you!
24120,81,4,17,"Robin, entering: Too glad you watched that one!"
24121,81,4,17,"Barney: My God, what has happened?"
24122,81,4,17,Robin: You have not seen the show?
24123,81,4,17,Barney: The show! Sorry. It happened something?
24124,81,4,17,Robin: The routine.
24125,81,4,17,Ted: Lily has just told us it made us break.
24126,81,4,17,Robin: What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown?
24127,81,4,17,Marshall: A shirt.
24128,81,4,17,Barney: It's called a shirt.
24129,81,4,17,"Ted: It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours."
24130,81,4,17,"Lily: Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch."
24131,81,4,17,"Ted, old: 2 of heart. As the heart of two children that I have ever had, because my lovely wife hates children."
24132,81,4,17,"Robin, old: Equality. As my career that fell when I decided to settle down and marry Ted. Bridge! I won."
24133,81,4,17,End flashback
24134,81,4,17,Marshall: I do not like this scenario.
24135,81,4,17,Lily: I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.
24136,81,4,17,Flashback
24137,81,4,17,"In April 2007, Ted and Lily are in the kitchen."
24138,81,4,17,"Lily: I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years?(Later that night, Lily is with Robin at McClaren's) You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years?"
24139,81,4,17,"The next night, Ted and Robin are in the restaurant."
24140,81,4,17,Ted: Where do you see yourself in five years?
24141,81,4,17,Robin: And you?
24142,81,4,17,"Lily: Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married."
24143,81,4,17,Ted: I would probably get married.
24144,81,4,17,Lily: You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris.
24145,81,4,17,Robin: I would surely be in Argentina.
24146,81,4,17,Ted: In Argentina?
24147,81,4,17,"Robin: Or Tokyo, or Paris."
24148,81,4,17,"Ted: We have a deadline, does not it?"
24149,81,4,17,End flashback
24150,81,4,17,Robin: My God.
24151,81,4,17,"Ted: You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!"
24152,81,4,17,Lily: I was not...
24153,81,4,17,Ted: I want to hear!
24154,81,4,17,Barney: Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?
24155,81,4,17,"Marshall: Come, let's check."
24156,81,4,17,"Robin: So, without you we would come out still together?"
24157,81,4,17,"Lily: Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends."
24158,81,4,17,Robin: Do not say that.
24159,81,4,17,Ted: Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.
24160,81,4,17,Lily: It is what happened to your jacket?
24161,81,4,17,"Robin: Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?"
24162,81,4,17,Barney and Marshall are installed in the same bed.
24163,81,4,17,"Barney: You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?"
24164,81,4,17,"Marshall: Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid."
24165,81,4,17,Barney: Tell me about marriage.
24166,81,4,17,"Marshall: Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready."
24167,81,4,17,Barney: The coffee too?
24168,81,4,17,Marshall: The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.
24169,81,4,17,"Barney: I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?"
24170,81,4,17,Marshall: It says you're great and everything will be fine.
24171,81,4,17,Barney: It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?
24172,81,4,17,"Marshall: I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ."
24173,81,4,17,"Ted (2030): The next night, I always wanted your aunt Lily.Until..."
24174,81,4,17,Ted arrives at the bar.
24175,81,4,17,Karen: What are you doing... (She kisses him before he finished his sentence) Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you.
24176,81,4,17,Ted reads the word that Lily wrote him.
24177,81,4,17,"Lily: Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily."
24178,81,4,17,Marshall: PS: Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall.
24179,81,4,17,"Karen: Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?"
24180,81,4,17,Ted thinks the porch with Karen.
24181,81,4,17,"Karen, old: Do you remember your college roommate? He was married to this girl's voice rattle."
24182,81,4,17,"Ted, old: It's been so long."
24183,81,4,17,"Karen, old: My God, I hated him. Finally, here is his obituary."
24184,81,4,17,Ted was at the apartment and talk to Robin.
24185,81,4,17,"Ted: I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends."
24186,81,4,17,"Robin: So, it's over?"
24187,81,4,17,"Ted: Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove."
24188,81,4,17,"Robin: beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house."
24189,81,4,17,Ted: Normal Marshall dies at age 68.
24190,81,4,17,Robin: Thank you.
24191,81,4,17,"Ted (2030): And with Robin, we're treated to a gourmet dinner.For her breakfast. And we ended up doing exactly what Lily wanted us to do: talk about our relationship."
24192,81,4,17,"Robin: Basically, Lily made us break."
24193,81,4,17,Ted: It makes you wonder.
24194,81,4,17,"Robin: If it had not been there, we always go out together?"
24195,81,4,17,"Ted: Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case."
24196,81,4,17,"Robin: We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone..."
24197,81,4,17,Ted: Will you be my wife back?
24198,81,4,17,"Robin: A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!"
24199,81,4,17,They hug.
24200,81,4,17,"Ted: Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?"
24201,81,4,17,Robin: Genre?
24202,81,4,17,"Ted: I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing."
24203,81,4,17,Robin: Just one thing: no nightgown.
24204,81,4,17,Ted: I'll never wear.
24205,81,4,17,Barney gets up and opens the door.
24206,82,4,18,"Ted (2030): In spring 2009, I was hired to design a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank. And I hasten to add up to the plans of architect my paw."
24207,82,4,18,"Ted is in the apartment, on his desk, drawing."
24208,82,4,18,Ted: Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!
24209,82,4,18,Ted (2030): There was a problem and his name was Bilson.
24210,82,4,18,Ted presents his project.
24211,82,4,18,"Bilson: Wood? Natural light? Oh, no! It reminds employees that there is an outside world where they have family and friends. We want to crush it! You arrive in the dark, you come home in the dark. You spend your whole damn day in the dark!"
24212,82,4,18,Marshall: I need to hear Lily.
24213,82,4,18,Marshall rises.
24214,82,4,18,Bilson: Who told you to leave?
24215,82,4,18,Then sits down.
24216,82,4,18,Ted (2030): Bilson killed every one of my original ideas. Then one day the GNB has withdrawn from the project to create a new working group to oversee my plans. Everything changed at once.
24217,82,4,18,"Ted: On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home."
24218,82,4,18,Ted (2030): Everything was fine until one day in the elevator.
24219,82,4,18,Ted takes the elevator when a woman is already there.
24220,82,4,18,"Ted: Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?"
24221,82,4,18,"Woman: Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try."
24222,82,4,18,The woman came out of the elevator.
24223,82,4,18,GENERIC
24224,82,4,18,"Lily, Marshall, Barney and Robin are in McClaren's."
24225,82,4,18,"Barney: Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue."
24226,82,4,18,"Marshall: If I got a celebrity, it would be Lily. This is the star of my heart."
24227,82,4,18,Lily: For me it would be Hugh Jackman.
24228,82,4,18,"Robin: You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me."
24229,82,4,18,Barney: How do you know that?
24230,82,4,18,"Robin: It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity."
24231,82,4,18,Lily: My God! Seriously?
24232,82,4,18,"Robin: He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story."
24233,82,4,18,"Lily: No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!"
24234,82,4,18,"Marshall: Please, calm down. You swallow too much air."
24235,82,4,18,"Barney: But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke."
24236,82,4,18,"Robin: Not you, Barney."
24237,82,4,18,Lily: Who's who?
24238,82,4,18,Marshall: Now you've spun him hiccups.
24239,82,4,18,"Robin: I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection."
24240,82,4,18,"Marshall: What do you mean ""collection""?"
24241,82,4,18,Robin: As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.
24242,82,4,18,Barney: Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.
24243,82,4,18,"Robin: I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much."
24244,82,4,18,Lily: So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian s*x act.
24245,82,4,18,Robin: Yes.
24246,82,4,18,Lily: Tell us.
24247,82,4,18,Robin: I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.
24248,82,4,18,Marshall: It is simply impossible.
24249,82,4,18,Robin: Right.
24250,82,4,18,Lily: I do not even know of Canadian s*x act.
24251,82,4,18,"Barney: You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police."
24252,82,4,18,Lily: How do you know that?
24253,82,4,18,"Barney: Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite."
24254,82,4,18,Marshall: Point org?
24255,82,4,18,Barney: Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.
24256,82,4,18,Ted joined them.
24257,82,4,18,"Ted: I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?"
24258,82,4,18,Barney: It is said? It should.
24259,82,4,18,Marshall: No. I want to.
24260,82,4,18,Barney: There's been no light.
24261,82,4,18,Ted: What's going on?
24262,82,4,18,"Marshall: It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us."

24264,82,4,18,"A few weeks earlier, Barney and Marshall are in the office of Bilson."
24265,82,4,18,Bilson: We abandon the project for the new headquarters. This recession is killing us. It cancels all the superfluous. And I have difficult choices to make during my semi retirement in St. Croix.
24266,82,4,18,"Marshall: Dude, Ted will be devastated."
24267,82,4,18,Bilson: Not if he learns his best friend.
24268,82,4,18,Marshall and Barney: I have to say?
24269,82,4,18,Marshall and Barney are at the bar.
24270,82,4,18,"Marshall: Tell him, you're his best friend."
24271,82,4,18,"Barney: No, it's you."
24272,82,4,18,"Marshall: No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens."
24273,82,4,18,"Barney: White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him."
24274,82,4,18,Ted: How are you?
24275,82,4,18,Marshall: You okay?
24276,82,4,18,"Ted: I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy."
24277,82,4,18,Barney: You should leave the project.
24278,82,4,18,"Marshall: It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you."
24279,82,4,18,Barney: It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...
24280,82,4,18,"Ted: Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work."
24281,82,4,18,Barney: It's funny you mention the project. Because...
24282,82,4,18,"Marshall: You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!"
24283,82,4,18,"Ted: Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me."
24284,82,4,18,"Ted from leaving Barn, ey and Marshall alone."
24285,82,4,18,Barney: What was that?
24286,82,4,18,Marshall: I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.
24287,82,4,18,Barney: You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.
24288,82,4,18,Marshall: But if I can.
24289,82,4,18,"Barney: Lie to me, there."
24290,82,4,18,Marshall: I have a spaceship.
24291,82,4,18,Barney: What kind of fuel?
24292,82,4,18,Marshall: I have no spaceship.
24293,82,4,18,"Barney: But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me."
24294,82,4,18,Marshall: It is what color?
24295,82,4,18,"Barney: When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help."
24296,82,4,18,"Marshall: My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?"
24297,82,4,18,End flashback
24298,82,4,18,Ted: So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.
24299,82,4,18,Marshall: We did it to protect you.
24300,82,4,18,Ted: I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.
24301,82,4,18,"Lily: In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious."
24302,82,4,18,Ted: This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.
24303,82,4,18,"Marshall: Sorry, Ted."
24304,82,4,18,Ted: I need a drink.
24305,82,4,18,Lily: The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on s*x?
24306,82,4,18,Marshall: Not at all.
24307,82,4,18,Barney: You've been slow.
24308,82,4,18,Lily: What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?
24309,82,4,18,"Robin: Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands."
24310,82,4,18,Lily: Pack milk Manitoba?
24311,82,4,18,"Robin: It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi."
24312,82,4,18,Lily: A Lobster Trap of Newfoundland?
24313,82,4,18,"Robin: I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy."
24314,82,4,18,"Lily: Well, I decided my first proposal."
24315,82,4,18,"Robin: Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection."
24316,82,4,18,"Lily: Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak."
24317,82,4,18,Robin: No.
24318,82,4,18,"Barney: Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling."
24319,82,4,18,Robin: No.
24320,82,4,18,"Marshall: Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake."
24321,82,4,18,Robin: No. I would have accepted it.
24322,82,4,18,"Ted: Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?"
24323,82,4,18,"Barney: Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson."
24324,82,4,18,Marshall: So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.
24325,82,4,18,Flashback
24326,82,4,18,"Marshall: You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance. (In the hallway...) I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money?"
24327,82,4,18,Roy: How far I have DESAPER?
24328,82,4,18,"Marshall: Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital exécutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria. (In the canteen...) Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak."
24329,82,4,18,Louisa: I speak English.
24330,82,4,18,"Marshall: Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say ""secret"" in Spanish?"
24331,82,4,18,Louisa: Pellets?
24332,82,4,18,"Marshall: Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street. (In the street...) Excuse me. One can argue?"
24333,82,4,18,"Arty: Actually, my assistant, Reginald took my appointments."
24334,82,4,18,A squirrel is on the sidewalk.
24335,82,4,18,Marshall: It was completed with the group of trainees and paid $ 50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked...
24336,82,4,18,"Arty: Reginald, next week, get me out of here."
24337,82,4,18,End flashback
24338,82,4,18,Ted: That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.
24339,82,4,18,"Lily: Alex Trebek, a Guardian Eventé, teddy bear!"
24340,82,4,18,Robin: No.
24341,82,4,18,Lily: Damn!
24342,82,4,18,Ted: Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.
24343,82,4,18,Flashback
24344,82,4,18,Ted has finished presenting his project.
24345,82,4,18,Marshall: Good job.
24346,82,4,18,Barney: All right!
24347,82,4,18,Ted: Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!
24348,82,4,18,Ted kisses her.
24349,82,4,18,"Louisa: No, I can not. I am engaged to Mr. Barney. We do not care. We live once!"
24350,82,4,18,She kisses him in turn.
24351,82,4,18,"Ted: No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!"
24352,82,4,18,End flashback
24353,82,4,18,Ted: Is there anything else you want to tell me?
24354,82,4,18,Marshall: When you played third base for the softball team GNB.
24355,82,4,18,"Barney: There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero."
24356,82,4,18,Ted: My lap of honor was bogus?
24357,82,4,18,"Marshall: Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that."
24358,82,4,18,Ted: Lying?
24359,82,4,18,"Marshall: Sometimes, yes, to protect them."
24360,82,4,18,Ted: False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.
24361,82,4,18,Barney: Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?
24362,82,4,18,Flashback
24363,82,4,18,"Marshall is on stage, microphone in hand."
24364,82,4,18,"Marshall: You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. ""Trout. ""Right? ""Sturgeon. ""I think so buddy.""Salmon. ""I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? ""Bar. ""This guy is what I mean. ""Halibut. ""Thank you, good evening. How do I?"
24365,82,4,18,Ted: Super. Very funny.
24366,82,4,18,Barney: Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.
24367,82,4,18,End flashback
24368,82,4,18,Marshall: Timeout. You do not like fish?
24369,82,4,18,Ted: It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.
24370,82,4,18,Marshall: Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.
24371,82,4,18,"Ted: It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone."
24372,82,4,18,Ted part.
24373,82,4,18,"Robin: For me, it's called a..."
24374,82,4,18,Lily: A Totem of Saskatoon. It's here.
24375,82,4,18,
24376,82,4,18,Marshall and Barney enters Ted's apartment.
24377,82,4,18,"Ted: Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?"
24378,82,4,18,Barney: Nice shirt.
24379,82,4,18,Ted: You're the devil.
24380,82,4,18,"Marshall: What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor."
24381,82,4,18,"Ted: If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?"
24382,82,4,18,"Ted, Barney and Marshall are the GNB, in a room."
24383,82,4,18,"Barney: This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us."
24384,82,4,18,"Ted: Wait, what is a P.T.E.?"
24385,82,4,18,Barney: Room for Transitional Employees.
24386,82,4,18,Ted: What does that mean?
24387,82,4,18,Barney: It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.
24388,82,4,18,Marshall: It turns people here.
24389,82,4,18,Ted: It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?
24390,82,4,18,Marshall: GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.
24391,82,4,18,Barney: It's serious there.
24392,82,4,18,Flashback
24393,82,4,18,"Barney is in P.T.E. with a man. The man throws himself on Barney. Then a woman does the same. Another man in the room with Barney and out, pressing his hand, then grabs a chair and breaks it on Barney. Another time, he emerged from under the table with a woman, they sit at the table and she attacks him."
24394,82,4,18,End flashback
24395,82,4,18,"Ted (2030): Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key."
24396,82,4,18,Ted presents his project.
24397,82,4,18,"Ted: Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call ""the Renaissance Corridor Quiet."" Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life."
24398,82,4,18,Bilson: I love.
24399,82,4,18,Barney: Really?
24400,82,4,18,"Bilson: Good job, Ted."
24401,82,4,18,Ted: Thank you.
24402,82,4,18,Bilson: You can add these keys to the PTE the 18th floor?
24403,82,4,18,Ted: Absolutely.
24404,82,4,18,Bilson: Awesome. 'll See about that.
24405,82,4,18,Bilson followed Ted will see the room from the 18th floor.
24406,82,4,18,"Ted: OK, I think this wall..."
24407,82,4,18,Bilson: You're fired!
24408,82,4,18,Ted: What?
24409,82,4,18,"Bilson: I wanted this piece! This same room, two floors up!"
24410,82,4,18,Ted: But...
24411,82,4,18,"Bilson: You're fired! Away from here. (His phone rings and Ted lot) Hi, honey."
24412,82,4,18,"Ted comes back in the room and takes a chair that breaks on Bilson, who is on the phone."
24413,82,4,18,Back at the bar...
24414,82,4,18,"Lily: Anyone of Rush, a Meat Pie from Montreal and a lunchbox superhero."
24415,82,4,18,Robin: No.
24416,82,4,18,"Lily: Rick Moranis, the Reverse Rich Moranis, of Jewish antiquities. I give up. It's been three days that I seek. I stop. If that means I could ever be."
24417,82,4,18,Robin: Well.
24418,82,4,18,Lily: Tell us about it!
24419,82,4,18,Robin: You really want to know?
24420,82,4,18,"Marshall, Lily and Barney: Yes!"
24421,82,4,18,Robin: But this info does not leave the table.
24422,82,4,18,Lily: My God. I am so excited. (Robin passes him a paper) I will read.
24423,82,4,18,Barney: Read it.
24424,82,4,18,Marshall: Read it.
24425,82,4,18,"Lily: I will read it. Let's go. ""The Frozen Snowshoe,"" ""Old King Clancy"", ""The Plateaux of Harvey."""
24426,82,4,18,Robin: So?
24427,82,4,18,Lily: I do not understand any of these words.
24428,82,4,18,Barney: One of them is supposed to be famous?
24429,82,4,18,Marshall: Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?
24430,82,4,18,"Robin: This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup."
24431,82,4,18,"Marshall: And fame, this is Harvey Léplateaux?"
24432,82,4,18,"Robin: No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!"
24433,82,4,18,Lily: So fame was...
24434,82,4,18,"Robin: The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick ""The Daredevil"" at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic."
24435,82,4,18,"Lily: So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?"
24436,82,4,18,"Robin: Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone."
24437,82,4,18,Lily: My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.
24438,82,4,18,Barney: You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?
24439,82,4,18,Ted joined them.
24440,82,4,18,"Marshall: Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?"
24441,82,4,18,Ted: I'm more about the project.
24442,82,4,18,Marshall: What?
24443,82,4,18,Ted: Bilson fired me.
24444,82,4,18,Marshall: You're kidding.
24445,82,4,18,Lily: What does that mean for your company? You're going to be fired?
24446,82,4,18,"Ted: Actually, I just resign."
24447,82,4,18,Marshall: Why?
24448,82,4,18,"Ted: I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your ""working group"", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned."
24449,82,4,18,"Barney: They've turned, eh?"
24450,82,4,18,"Ted: Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box."
24451,82,4,18,Lily: It's exciting.
24452,82,4,18,Barney: With this economy?
24453,82,4,18,"Marshall: So, do we want it?"
24454,82,4,18,"Ted: Ultimately, I am grateful."
24455,82,4,18,Barney: What was it with Bilson?
24456,82,4,18,"Ted: After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee."
24457,82,4,18,Barney: You've hit with a chair?
24458,82,4,18,Ted: Yeah.
24459,82,4,18,Barney: Well done.
24460,82,4,18,"British Columbia 2002, shows a man Robin trays."
24461,82,4,18,"Man: That one, I got to the restaurant between Milverton and Wawa."
24462,82,4,18,"Robin: It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe."
24463,82,4,18,"Man: We're friends. Call me ""racket"". Sit down."
24464,82,4,18,Robin: So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?
24465,82,4,18,Snowshoeing: You should go.
24466,83,4,19,"Barney goes to the apartment where Marshall, Robin and Ted are already."
24467,83,4,19,Barney: You believe not what happened last night laser tag.
24468,83,4,19,Ted: People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?
24469,83,4,19,"Barney: Yeah, almost."
24470,83,4,19,Flashback
24471,83,4,19,Barney played laser tag with children. It takes a little girl in her arms and hides behind a phony.
24472,83,4,19,Barney: Go! You want that!
24473,83,4,19,Girl: My shoulder!
24474,83,4,19,Barney: Come on.
24475,83,4,19,"Pattern: Stinson, in my office! Now!"
24476,83,4,19,Barney: sh1t.
24477,83,4,19,Barney is in the boss's office of laser tag.
24478,83,4,19,"Pattern: Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!"
24479,83,4,19,"Barney: I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!"
24480,83,4,19,"McCracken: Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you."
24481,83,4,19,Barney: You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.
24482,83,4,19,"McCracken is Enough You are banned, Stinson! Make your gun and your badge!"
24483,83,4,19,Barney: My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.
24484,83,4,19,"McCracken: I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck shooting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!"
24485,83,4,19,Barney: You regret it.
24486,83,4,19,"30 seconds later, Barney has his foot on a guy and shoots him."
24487,83,4,19,"McCracken: It's over, Stinson. You are banned for life!"

24489,83,4,19,GENERIC
24490,83,4,19,Marshall: I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?
24491,83,4,19,Barney: What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.
24492,83,4,19,"Ted: Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag."
24493,83,4,19,"Barney: Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle."
24494,83,4,19,"Ted: Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh."
24495,83,4,19,Barney: No list of Murtaugh.
24496,83,4,19,Robin: What is the Murtaugh list?
24497,83,4,19,Ted (2030): The Murtaugh list was created around my 30th birthday. It all started with the beer funnel your uncle.
24498,83,4,19,Flashback
24499,83,4,19,Ted and Marshall are at a party.
24500,83,4,19,"Marshall:... two, one, chug!"
24501,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): In our 20 years, with each party, this funnel came out. And to our 30 years, none. Of course, at age 20, the day looked like this. (Marshall and Ted fight) But to our 30 years, the day looked like this. (Ted is sitting on the couch, the trash next to him) Then one day, in the suffering of the worst hangover of my life, I realized that one person in the world understood me: Detective Roger Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover in the masterpiece 1987: Lethal Weapon, known for his often repeated motto:"
24502,83,4,19,Roger Murtaugh: I'm too old for this...

24505,83,4,19,"Ted: It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night."
24506,83,4,19,Marshall: I'm too old for this stuff.
24507,83,4,19,Ted: Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.
24508,83,4,19,Marshall: I'm too old for this stuff.
24509,83,4,19,Ted: Or put posters on the wall without a frame.
24510,83,4,19,"Marshall: ""Riggs. ""I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal Weapon?"
24511,83,4,19,"Robin: I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is killed by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta..."
24512,83,4,19,Marshall: I gotta go.
24513,83,4,19,"Lily: Hi, baby. Good workout."
24514,83,4,19,Robin: What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap.
24515,83,4,19,Marshall is in a gym with children.
24516,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): In fact, Marshall was to coach the basketball team's class Lily. He thought it was funny, but Lily was dizzy: training father."
24517,83,4,19,Lily arrives with a basket.
24518,83,4,19,Marshall: My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?
24519,83,4,19,Lily: I could not resist. I wanted to see Marshmallow coach at work.
24520,83,4,19,"Marshall: The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?"
24521,83,4,19,All: Yeah!
24522,83,4,19,"Marshall: Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little sh1ts, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! Suicide, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go."
24523,83,4,19,At the apartment...
24524,83,4,19,"Barney: There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend."
24525,83,4,19,"Ted: Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge."
24526,83,4,19,"Barney: Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me."
24527,83,4,19,Ted: And if you fail?
24528,83,4,19,Barney: I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.
24529,83,4,19,"Ted: It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?"
24530,83,4,19,Robin: An agreement of honor!
24531,83,4,19,"Barney: Come on guys, you do it!"
24532,83,4,19,Robin: Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.
24533,83,4,19,"Ted: There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?"
24534,83,4,19,"Barney: ""To pierce the ear. ""Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon?"
24535,83,4,19,Robin: There is no futon.
24536,83,4,19,"Barney: Put it there, guys."
24537,83,4,19,Robin: What's the matter?
24538,83,4,19,"Barney: It's on the list. ""Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. """
24539,83,4,19,Robin: I'm too old for this stuff.
24540,83,4,19,Ted: You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.
24541,83,4,19,"Barney: What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, ""pushing a medical"" on the list. (His phone rings) Hold on. Bar here..."
24542,83,4,19,A basketball practice in Marshall...
24543,83,4,19,"Marshall: It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things. (He throws the basketball on a kid) you not being there! You fall!"
24544,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room."
24545,83,4,19,"Barney: Done. (Barney is McClaren's) ""Drinking shots with strangers. ""Done."
24546,83,4,19,"Ted: OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back."
24547,83,4,19,"Barney: No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth! (He can not drink his glass) You should have a straw?"
24548,83,4,19,Robin: There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?
24549,83,4,19,"Ted: This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect."
24550,83,4,19,"Robin: It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey."
24551,83,4,19,"Ted: I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older."
24552,83,4,19,Lily is always with Marshall at basketball practice.
24553,83,4,19,"Lily: Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?"
24554,83,4,19,"Marshall: I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow."
24555,83,4,19,Lily: Winning? There are no points.
24556,83,4,19,Marshall: What?
24557,83,4,19,Lily: There are no points.
24558,83,4,19,"Marshall: You not count... What interest not to do? How do you know... Lily, what were you doing with the team before I arrive?"
24559,83,4,19,Lily: I was training.
24560,83,4,19,Flashback
24561,83,4,19,"Lily is sitting in the stands and plays guitar, while the kids play basketball."
24562,83,4,19,Lily: That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light.
24563,83,4,19,Boy: What's the score?
24564,83,4,19,Lily: Gender: joy joy!
24565,83,4,19,End flashback
24566,83,4,19,"Lily: Because that's the point of playing, having fun."
24567,83,4,19,"Marshall: The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?"
24568,83,4,19,"Lily: Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one."
24569,83,4,19,Marshall: Everything that's Chinese to me.
24570,83,4,19,Barney at the bar with Robin and Ted.
24571,83,4,19,"Barney: Hi, this is Barney."
24572,83,4,19,Robin: And Robin.
24573,83,4,19,Barney: We can not answer because...
24574,83,4,19,Robin: He watches football and I'm...
24575,83,4,19,"Barney: Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded..."
24576,83,4,19,Robin:... soon...
24577,83,4,19,Barney:... we...
24578,83,4,19,Robin and Barney:... can!
24579,83,4,19,"Barney: ""Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.""Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay."
24580,83,4,19,Robin: Your ear begins to feel.
24581,83,4,19,Barney: It's good.
24582,83,4,19,"Ted: I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself."
24583,83,4,19,Robin: Okay. It's good. You have your own list.
24584,83,4,19,Ted: What?
24585,83,4,19,Robin: A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.
24586,83,4,19,"Ted: Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch."
24587,83,4,19,"Barney: New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever."
24588,83,4,19,"Ted: Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good."
24589,83,4,19,Barney: Bet held.
24590,83,4,19,Robin: An agreement of honor!
24591,83,4,19,
24592,83,4,19,Back to basketball practice...
24593,83,4,19,"Lily: Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that."
24594,83,4,19,Marshall: Sure. I learned that way.
24595,83,4,19,Lily: Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?
24596,83,4,19,Flashback
24597,83,4,19,"Marshall plays basketball, outside his home with his father."
24598,83,4,19,"Marshall: Come on, Dad. I'm tired."
24599,83,4,19,Father: Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled.
24600,83,4,19,Marshall: I'm trying.
24601,83,4,19,Father: I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.
24602,83,4,19,End flashback
24603,83,4,19,"Marshall: With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching!"
24604,83,4,19,Ted is at his apartment.
24605,83,4,19,"Ted: ""Put on reading glasses. ""Done. ""Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. ""With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Robin and Barney come but this box) What happened to you?"
24606,83,4,19,"Barney: I just had a little ""screw up my knee and it hurts"" incident."
24607,83,4,19,Ted: How did you do?
24608,83,4,19,"Barney: It... ""Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer."""
24609,83,4,19,Robin: Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.
24610,83,4,19,"Barney's counting anyway. Now I will go ""Me dye flashy colors,"" and then we will go to ""Go to a rave."""
24611,83,4,19,Ted: 16 pm! Supper time.
24612,83,4,19,Marshall puts basketballs.
24613,83,4,19,"Lily: Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes."
24614,83,4,19,"Marshall: Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children."
24615,83,4,19,"Lily: OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?"
24616,83,4,19,Marshall: There are different...
24617,83,4,19,Lily: Is that clear?
24618,83,4,19,"Marshall: Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that..."
24619,83,4,19,"Lily Marshall launches a chair, he avoids."
24620,83,4,19,Barney and Robin are at a rave.
24621,83,4,19,Barney: Ted Calls. I want to go.
24622,83,4,19,Robin: Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened.
24623,83,4,19,Ted: Got up at 4am... Done.
24624,83,4,19,Barney: It answers?
24625,83,4,19,Robin: I have not called yet.
24626,83,4,19,"Barney: Hurry up, Robin."
24627,83,4,19,"At Ted, the phone rings."
24628,83,4,19,"Ted: Okay. ""Take time to answer the phone. """
24629,83,4,19,"Barney: Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was."
24630,83,4,19,Ted: Done.
24631,83,4,19,It's game day for Marshall and his team.
24632,83,4,19,"Marshall: I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun."
24633,83,4,19,The referee and the children rush the field.
24634,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): Children, over time your Uncle Marshall rehashed the story this game hundreds of times. And in fact, children from the other team were older than one class. But harping on the story, they looked like that."
24635,83,4,19,The opposing team is an adult.
24636,83,4,19,"Marshall: Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not shoot! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?"
24637,83,4,19,"Referee: I'm no referee, but Kenny. And watch your tone."
24638,83,4,19,"Marshall: No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later."
24639,83,4,19,"Robin, Barney and Ted return to the apartment."
24640,83,4,19,"Robin: As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast."
24641,83,4,19,"Barney: No, he remains a. ""The beer funnel. """
24642,83,4,19,"Ted: It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement."
24643,83,4,19,Robin: The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?
24644,83,4,19,"Ted: Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem."
24645,83,4,19,"Barney: No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is killing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff."
24646,83,4,19,"Ted: You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal Weapon."
24647,83,4,19,Flashback
24648,83,4,19,Ted is on the couch and watch TV.
24649,83,4,19,"Ted: I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal Weapon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal Weapon 4, I realized..."
24650,83,4,19,End flashback
24651,83,4,19,"Ted:... that Murtaugh kept repeating: ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag."
24652,83,4,19,Barney: And then the hospital.
24653,83,4,19,At the basketball game...
24654,83,4,19,"Marshall: Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0."
24655,83,4,19,"Boy: What are we doing wrong, coach?"
24656,83,4,19,"Marshall: You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun."
24657,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): Because they did not want to argue in front of children, your uncle and your aunt Lily Marshall had a telepathic conversation."
24658,83,4,19,Lily: Do not look at me like that.
24659,83,4,19,Marshall: I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!
24660,83,4,19,Lily: Stop yelling at me!
24661,83,4,19,Marshall: I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?
24662,83,4,19,"Lily: OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar."
24663,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): Was it the determination of Marshall, Lily of encouragement, or the magic combination of both, but in the second half, the disorganized group of little urchins... have actually made things worse. In fact, according to Uncle Marshall, in the second half, the other team had even grown.And one of them had changed into a werewolf."
24664,83,4,19,Marshall: There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.
24665,83,4,19,"Lily: They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded."
24666,83,4,19,"Marshall: It was not a market, right? You're killing me! You kill me outright!"
24667,83,4,19,"Kenny: Attention, coach, or I put a technical foul."
24668,83,4,19,Marshall: I beg you to put me in one.
24669,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): When the final whistle sounded charitably, the score was, according to the estimate of Marshall, 118 to nothing. And even if they did not win, everyone, including the coach, received a trophy for participation."
24670,83,4,19,Lily: I understand that you like it not.
24671,83,4,19,Marshall: I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.
24672,83,4,19,"Lily: I know, baby."
24673,83,4,19,Marshall: Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.
24674,83,4,19,Lily: Thank you. Yours is.
24675,83,4,19,"Ted, Barney and Robin meet the PQ laser tag."
24676,83,4,19,McCracken: My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.
24677,83,4,19,Barney: Really?
24678,83,4,19,"McCracken: Good God, no! I call the police! Major cons with pink hair that dangle from the PQ. Are you kidding. I'm too old for this..."
24679,83,4,19,"Ted (2030): Stuff. He said ""Stuff""."
24680,84,4,20,"Ted, Barney and Marshall are at McClaren's and Lily joined them."
24681,84,4,20,Barney: I heard a joke at work.
24682,84,4,20,"Ted: Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls."
24683,84,4,20,"Barney: It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it."
24684,84,4,20,Marshall: Do it yourself.
24685,84,4,20,Lily: Tell it.
24686,84,4,20,Barney: Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella? (Marshall laughs) It's funny.
24687,84,4,20,Ted: For the guys.
24688,84,4,20,Marshall: She will not like it.
24689,84,4,20,Lily: Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?
24690,84,4,20,"Ted (2030): Can Barney gave the fall. To date, it remains the most disgusting joke I have ever heard in my life. And no, I do not say."
24691,84,4,20,"Lily: Yeah, I can not hang out with you."
24692,84,4,20,Lily leaves the bar.
24693,84,4,20,Barney: Come on. It's funny. This is...
24694,84,4,20,Ted: I told you so.
24695,84,4,20,Barney: She'll be back.
24696,84,4,20,Ted (2030): And we saw more Lily for 4 weeks.
24697,84,4,20,GENERIC
24698,84,4,20,"Ted (2030): The children, after being fired, I finally realized my lifelong dream: to create my own architectural firm. I had just customers."
24699,84,4,20,Ted checks the phone.
24700,84,4,20,"Robin, out of the room: I think it's great that you fly with your own wings. I admire that."
24701,84,4,20,Ted: Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.
24702,84,4,20,"Robin: Yeah, sure. Anything you want."
24703,84,4,20,"Ted: A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?"
24704,84,4,20,Robin: It's not work!
24705,84,4,20,"Ted: Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!"
24706,84,4,20,"Robin: I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs."
24707,84,4,20,Ted: I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.
24708,84,4,20,Barney comes to see that Marshall is in his office.
24709,84,4,20,Barney: You know for layoffs?
24710,84,4,20,"Marshall: Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?"
24711,84,4,20,"Barney: Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire."
24712,84,4,20,Marshall: I would like to have your insurance.
24713,84,4,20,Barney: You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.
24714,84,4,20,Marshall: I work harder than anyone in my division.
24715,84,4,20,Barney: Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.
24716,84,4,20,Marshall: What do you mean something?
24717,84,4,20,"Barney: You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco."
24718,84,4,20,Flashback
24719,84,4,20,Barney is in a meeting.
24720,84,4,20,"Ted (2030): Marcus Denisco worked in accounting, and it was probably the worst employee of the box."
24721,84,4,20,Marcus: I brought donuts. They are probably stupid.
24722,84,4,20,"Ted (2030): But ultimately, it was called..."
24723,84,4,20,All: Chow-man!
24724,84,4,20,Marcus: Who wants pork barbecue? Of course you want!
24725,84,4,20,End flashback
24726,84,4,20,Marshall: I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?
24727,84,4,20,Barney: It's always food.
24728,84,4,20,Marshall: It's always food.
24729,84,4,20,Barney: You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.
24730,84,4,20,Marshall: I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.
24731,84,4,20,"Barney: Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man."
24732,84,4,20,Flashback
24733,84,4,20,"Marshall and Barney are in the office filled with toys, one of their colleagues."
24734,84,4,20,"Toy-Man: Bad news. As HR, I must review the new overtime policy with you. The good news is that we will do with Wolverine's claws! (They start to play all three) Section 5A: doing overtime will no longer be paid double."
24735,84,4,20,Marshall: That's great!
24736,84,4,20,Barney: Claw tape!
24737,84,4,20,End flashback
24738,84,4,20,Marshall: I love Toy-man.

24741,84,4,20,Marshall and Barney watch a video in the office of another of their colleagues.
24742,84,4,20,End flashback
24743,84,4,20,Marshall: You're right. I need something.
24744,84,4,20,Barney: But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.
24745,84,4,20,Flashback
24746,84,4,20,Marshall and Barney are in the conference room.
24747,84,4,20,Barney: You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.
24748,84,4,20,"Massage man, massaging the shoulders of Marshall: Hi, dude."
24749,84,4,20,"Marshall: Hi, Douglas."
24750,84,4,20,Douglas: You're so tense.
24751,84,4,20,"Marshall: I was relaxed, two seconds ago."
24752,84,4,20,"Douglas, Barney: You're next."

24754,84,4,20,Robin returned to the apartment.
24755,84,4,20,Man: Welcome to Mosbius Designs.
24756,84,4,20,Robin: Who are you?
24757,84,4,20,"Man: PJ, the assistant of Mr. Mosby."
24758,84,4,20,Robin: What's going on?
24759,84,4,20,PJ: Sorry. You do not interrupt Mr. Mosby during his hours of reflection.
24760,84,4,20,"Ted, by phone at PJ interposed: Good, PJ. This is Robin. She lives here."
24761,84,4,20,"PJ: Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. You need something else?"
24762,84,4,20,Ted: I would not refuse a cup of coffee.
24763,84,4,20,Robin: You're right next door!
24764,84,4,20,Ted and Robin went down to the bar where Barney goes with them.
24765,84,4,20,Robin: So now Ted is assisted to do nothing.
24766,84,4,20,"Ted: PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind."
24767,84,4,20,"Robin: Yes, the guide."
24768,84,4,20,Flashback
24769,84,4,20,Ted is in the apartment with a man eats and Robin.
24770,84,4,20,Ted: I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.
24771,84,4,20,"Man: I will. Thank you very much, Mr. Mosby."
24772,84,4,20,Ted: All right.
24773,84,4,20,The man left the apartment and Robin puts his ear on the table.
24774,84,4,20,Robin: This table just told me that you're an idiot.
24775,84,4,20,End flashback
24776,84,4,20,Robin: This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.
24777,84,4,20,"Ted: I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test."
24778,84,4,20,"Robin: Okay, but PJ does not help."
24779,84,4,20,"Barney: If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere."
24780,84,4,20,Ted: You see? It is useful.
24781,84,4,20,"Barney: PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?"
24782,84,4,20,"Ted: No, I guide him."
24783,84,4,20,"Barney: A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?"
24784,84,4,20,Ted: Ted Mosby?
24785,84,4,20,"Barney: Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead!(He rises) PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me."
24786,84,4,20,"Everyone leaves the meeting room, Marshall called Barney who is about to leave too."
24787,84,4,20,"Marshall: I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?"
24788,84,4,20,Barney: Fired. What else you got?
24789,84,4,20,Marshall: I have others. Ties-Fun-man.
24790,84,4,20,Barney: Fired.
24791,84,4,20,Marshall: Info-Unusual-man?
24792,84,4,20,Barney: Did you know? Whether you're fired?
24793,84,4,20,Marshall: Stretch-man?
24794,84,4,20,Barney: upside down Viré.
24795,84,4,20,Marshall: The Monty-Python-man?
24796,84,4,20,Barney: We are the knights who say... You're fired.
24797,84,4,20,Marshall: Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.
24798,84,4,20,Barney: Not bad. You got maybe something.
24799,84,4,20,Marshall: Great! Great! I Simulates-man!
24800,84,4,20,"Barney: Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man."
24801,84,4,20,"Man: OK, guys?"
24802,84,4,20,"Barney: Hi, Frank."
24803,84,4,20,Ted size pen when the phone rings.
24804,84,4,20,"Ted: Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time. (Hangs up) Wait.""Ted Mosby House."" The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?"
24805,84,4,20,"Robin: At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together."
24806,84,4,20,Flashback
24807,84,4,20,Ted is at the door of the apartment while PJ is behind his desk.
24808,84,4,20,Ted: Inspiration... do your work.
24809,84,4,20,"PJ: Each time, chief. Every time."
24810,84,4,20,"He left the apartment, leaving Robin with PJ."
24811,84,4,20,"Robin: Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?"
24812,84,4,20,"PJ: No idea, but probably the taste of engineering."
24813,84,4,20,Robin: It's locked?
24814,84,4,20,PJ: Visitors must register for the key.
24815,84,4,20,"Robin: Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?"
24816,84,4,20,PJ: I tell you that you must ask permission to use the toilet in my premises.
24817,84,4,20,Robin: Why does it excite me?
24818,84,4,20,She grabs him by the neck and kisses him.
24819,84,4,20,End flashback
24820,84,4,20,Ted: There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?
24821,84,4,20,"Robin: When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?"
24822,84,4,20,Flashback
24823,84,4,20,
24824,84,4,20,Robin is at the bar with a man.
24825,84,4,20,"Man: I distribute the newspaper, it's dirty but someone has to do. Do not worry, I wash them before you fiddle with the parties."
24826,84,4,20,Then with another...
24827,84,4,20,"Man: I live with my mom. In the evening they watch TV in bed.It's called ""The club hugs."""
24828,84,4,20,And yet another...
24829,84,4,20,"Robin: So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?"
24830,84,4,20,"Man: Look, we'll do it or not?"
24831,84,4,20,End flashback
24832,84,4,20,"Ted: First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity."
24833,84,4,20,Robin: What productivity? You did not call a single customer.
24834,84,4,20,"Ted: Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call."
24835,84,4,20,Robin: Seminar?
24836,84,4,20,PJ: Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.
24837,84,4,20,Marshall is in his office when Barney comes to see.
24838,84,4,20,Barney: Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.
24839,84,4,20,"Marshall: It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money."
24840,84,4,20,Flashback
24841,84,4,20,Marshall is in the meeting room.
24842,84,4,20,"Grub-man: Good job, Sport-man. That's last week."
24843,84,4,20,"Marshall: 60, 80, 100. $ 18 000 in cash. It's nothing. I'll bring it home and put them in a safe place. (Marshall is in the street) OK, walk down the street with money in his pocket. Not touch the money. It's so obvious. Be natural. The baby looks at me.Babies can smell money. It is known! I carry a lot of money!"
24844,84,4,20,He starts running.
24845,84,4,20,End flashback
24846,84,4,20,Barney and Marshall are in McClaren's.
24847,84,4,20,"Marshall: Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep."
24848,84,4,20,Barney: Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.
24849,84,4,20,Marshall: A waste?
24850,84,4,20,Barney: Last week!
24851,84,4,20,"Ted enters the bar, followed by Robin."
24852,84,4,20,Marshall: This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?
24853,84,4,20,"Ted: Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant."
24854,84,4,20,"Robin: This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice."
24855,84,4,20,"Barney: I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!"
24856,84,4,20,Barney and Marshall away.
24857,84,4,20,"Marshall: Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?"
24858,84,4,20,Barney: Because it hurts!
24859,84,4,20,Marshall: How so?
24860,84,4,20,Barney: It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.
24861,84,4,20,"Marshall: I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives."
24862,84,4,20,"Barney: It's funny anyway, right?"
24863,84,4,20,Marshall: It's very funny.
24864,84,4,20,Ted comes home and finds PJ behind his desk.
24865,84,4,20,"Ted: Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that."
24866,84,4,20,A photo of Robin and PJ.
24867,84,4,20,PJ: You know what? I had to send the wrong photo.
24868,84,4,20,"Ted: You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a shooting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired."
24869,84,4,20,PJ: You can not fire me...
24870,84,4,20,Ted: You're fired.
24871,84,4,20,"PJ: Well! (He takes his phone) Hi, baby, I've just been fired.Yes, I'll wait with you. (He settles on the couch and turn on the TV) The Wheel of Fortune."
24872,84,4,20,Robin is with PJ on the couch.
24873,84,4,20,PJ: I like having all this time to spend with you book. I'll kiss you there... And there... And here and there. And...
24874,84,4,20,Robin: One more.
24875,84,4,20,Ted: Stop.
24876,84,4,20,PJ: I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you.
24877,84,4,20,Robin: I'll miss you too.
24878,84,4,20,PJ gets up and goes to the bathroom.
24879,84,4,20,Ted: You've already tired of him.
24880,84,4,20,"Robin: It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream."
24881,84,4,20,"Ted: ""It's the dream""? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?"
24882,84,4,20,"Robin: I have to stop, right? I know not break."
24883,84,4,20,"PJ: I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you."
24884,84,4,20,"Robin: Listen... Dude, I know."
24885,84,4,20,PJ: What?
24886,84,4,20,"Robin: Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?"
24887,84,4,20,PJ: It's on what?
24888,84,4,20,Robin: I feel it.
24889,84,4,20,PJ: Do you not feel anything?
24890,84,4,20,Robin: But friends and others.
24891,84,4,20,"Ted: My God, this is the worst break."
24892,84,4,20,PJ: You're breaking up with me?
24893,84,4,20,"Robin: If this is what you want, I totally understand."
24894,84,4,20,Marshall and Barney are in the boardroom.
24895,84,4,20,Toy-man: You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.
24896,84,4,20,"Barney: You see, Sports-man. People adore you."
24897,84,4,20,"Marshall: I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow."
24898,84,4,20,"Douglas: Hi, dude. We need you to do this exchange, I can prepare my team. You are really tight, is it not?"
24899,84,4,20,"Marshall: Seriously, it's over."
24900,84,4,20,Douglas: I stop?
24901,84,4,20,Marshall: No.
24902,84,4,20,"Ted (2030): With the breakdown of Robin and PJ, I was free to change the personnel office."
24903,84,4,20,"Robin returned to the apartment, where Ted works."
24904,84,4,20,PJ: Welcome Mosbius Designs.
24905,84,4,20,Robin: Are you kidding?
24906,84,4,20,Ted (2030): Now that PJ came back to work...
24907,84,4,20,Ted returned to the apartment and finds Robin and PJ kissing on the couch.
24908,84,4,20,Ted: Are you kidding?
24909,84,4,20,Marshall and Barney are at the bar.
24910,84,4,20,"Marshall: Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again."
24911,84,4,20,Barney: You're kidding!
24912,84,4,20,Marshall: How are you?
24913,84,4,20,"Barney: As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait..."
24914,84,4,20,Marshall: I know you're in love with Robin.
24915,84,4,20,Barney: What?
24916,84,4,20,Marshall: Lily told me.
24917,84,4,20,Barney: She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.
24918,84,4,20,"Marshall: Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other."
24919,84,4,20,Barney: Really?
24920,84,4,20,Marshall: It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.
24921,84,4,20,"Barney: Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket."
24922,84,4,20,Marshall: Tell her how you feel?
24923,84,4,20,"Barney: No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him."
24924,84,4,20,Marshall: I can perhaps help you.
24925,84,4,20,"Barney: You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it."
24926,84,4,20,PJ returned to the apartment with flowers.
24927,84,4,20,"Ted (2030): Meanwhile, I thank you without fight against Robin and PJ continued."
24928,84,4,20,Ted: I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?
24929,84,4,20,Robin: I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?
24930,84,4,20,"PJ: Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss."
24931,84,4,20,Meeting Room of Goliath National Bank...
24932,84,4,20,Chow-Man: Manny Ramirez is not exchange against two replacements!
24933,84,4,20,"Toy-man: If you put your veto, I am going!"
24934,84,4,20,PJ: I'll find something.
24935,84,4,20,"Barney: Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate."
24936,84,4,20,Robin returned to the apartment while Ted is at his desk.
24937,84,4,20,Robin: Are you okay?
24938,84,4,20,Ted: And if I did not think the books?
24939,84,4,20,Robin: Sorry?
24940,84,4,20,"Ted: There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?"
24941,84,4,20,"Robin: No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers."
24942,84,4,20,"Ted: The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began."
24943,84,4,20,"Robin: You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy ""funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious."" And apparently, I just... ""In my apartment."" You thought that you would have understood, now?"
24944,84,4,20,"Ted: Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses."
24945,84,4,20,Robin: You can do it.
24946,84,4,20,Ted picks up the phone and dials a number.
24947,84,4,20,"Ted: Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future."
24948,84,4,20,Robin: It looks good.
24949,84,4,20,Ted: I looked confident?
24950,84,4,20,Robin: Now known as a real customer.
24951,84,4,20,Ted: Great.
24952,84,4,20,Marshall and Barney eats in the boardroom.
24953,84,4,20,"Marshall: Hey, Chow-man!"
24954,84,4,20,"Barney: Hey, Toy-man!"
24955,84,4,20,Marshall: Who's this guy?
24956,84,4,20,Barney: He is not here. I think we should leave.
24957,84,4,20,Marshall: Really?
24958,84,4,20,Barney: It's happened before.
24959,85,4,21,Ted is in McClaren's number and its exchange with a woman.
24960,85,4,21,Ted: Super. So I'll call you.
24961,85,4,21,Woman: I hope so.
24962,85,4,21,"The woman leaves and Ted joins Barney, Marshall and Robin at their usual table."
24963,85,4,21,Marshall: Look at this.
24964,85,4,21,Ted: I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.
24965,85,4,21,"Barney: Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily."
24966,85,4,21,"Marshall: Yeah, it's true."
24967,85,4,21,"Barney: And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys."
24968,85,4,21,"Ted: You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw."
24969,85,4,21,Barney: You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.
24970,85,4,21,"Ted: This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him."""
24971,85,4,21,Barney: Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-fuck-ever.
24972,85,4,21,"Ted: My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?"
24973,85,4,21,Barney: Jesus.
24974,85,4,21,"Marshall: Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus."
24975,85,4,21,"Barney: Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say:"" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude."""
24976,85,4,21,Robin: The dialogues seem pompous old now.
24977,85,4,21,"Barney: And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three."
24978,85,4,21,"Ted: I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking."
24979,85,4,21,"Barney: And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story."
24980,85,4,21,GENERIC
24981,85,4,21,Ted: Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.
24982,85,4,21,Ted is in the apartment.
24983,85,4,21,"Ted (2030): But I said nothing about texting. I started with something pretty and charming. ""I thought about you, then, I thought you send a text message piti."" By pressing send, I realized that it was not at all charming. That was the thing that sucks the most anyone has told someone. And the worst with texting, is that once sent... can not recover them. And then...(23 minutes later...) you wait. And just when you decided to never again send a text message... (His phone rings) ""I thought you too, it's crazy that you send me a text when I'm in my bath."""
24984,85,4,21,Holly is in her bath with her phone and Robin leaves his room.
24985,85,4,21,Robin: What was that?
24986,85,4,21,Ted: What?
24987,85,4,21,Robin: You made a noise.
24988,85,4,21,"Ted: This is my laptop, a text message."
24989,85,4,21,Robin: Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.
24990,85,4,21,Ted: What?
24991,85,4,21,"Robin: When you see a naked girl, you make noise."
24992,85,4,21,Ted: That's not true.
24993,85,4,21,Robin: Really?
24994,85,4,21,Flashback
24995,85,4,21,"Ted enters the bathroom, but once spring."
24996,85,4,21,"Ted: Sorry, Lily."
24997,85,4,21,Ted and Robin are watching TV.
24998,85,4,21,"Voice: While the men hunt, women of the Korowai tribe native wash their clothes in the river."
24999,85,4,21,They are now in the museum.
25000,85,4,21,Ted: It's a breast.
25001,85,4,21,End flashback
25002,85,4,21,Robin: This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?
25003,85,4,21,"Ted: To call. Texting, it's different."
25004,85,4,21,"Robin: Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl."
25005,85,4,21,Ted: I make no noise.
25006,85,4,21,Robin: Really?
25007,85,4,21,"She opens her robe and went to the bathroom while Ted is the ""noise""."
25008,85,4,21,"Ted (2030): Holly and I, we had sent text messages until 2am.And all the next day, too. It seemed perfect."
25009,85,4,21,Ted: Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.
25010,85,4,21,"Robin: Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you."
25011,85,4,21,Ted: How do you know?
25012,85,4,21,"Robin: Because no woman in history has never, ""asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. """
25013,85,4,21,"Ted: Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad."
25014,85,4,21,Robin: What?
25015,85,4,21,Ted: She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.
25016,85,4,21,"Robin: ""Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. ""Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill."
25017,85,4,21,Ted: Come down.
25018,85,4,21,"Robin: ""And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.""Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry."
25019,85,4,21,Robin joins Marshall and Barney at the bar.
25020,85,4,21,Robin: Hi guys! What is it?
25021,85,4,21,Marshall: A meal that I Generro back to Lily.
25022,85,4,21,Robin: Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!
25023,85,4,21,Barney: What?
25024,85,4,21,Robin: You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?
25025,85,4,21,"Barney: We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine."
25026,85,4,21,"Marshall: We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages."
25027,85,4,21,Flashback
25028,85,4,21,Marshall and Barney are at the bar.
25029,85,4,21,"Barney: ""Piti texting""?"
25030,85,4,21,"Marshall: Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous."
25031,85,4,21,Barney: Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.
25032,85,4,21,Marshall: It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.
25033,85,4,21,"Barney: It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy."
25034,85,4,21,Marshall: It's better.
25035,85,4,21,Ted was at the apartment in a bathrobe and cowboy boots.
25036,85,4,21,Ted: I wear them right now and they are very sexy.
25037,85,4,21,Barney: He put the boots!
25038,85,4,21,Marshall: He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.
25039,85,4,21,Barney: Or... we remove our shirts.
25040,85,4,21,Marshall: It's better.
25041,85,4,21,"Barney: Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace."
25042,85,4,21,Marshall: I believe that wearing anything underneath.
25043,85,4,21,Barney: It is hot.
25044,85,4,21,"Marshall: There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!"
25045,85,4,21,Barney: Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?
25046,85,4,21,Marshall: I think we'll... have s*x with Ted.
25047,85,4,21,End flashback
25048,85,4,21,Robin: You did this all day? This is wicked.
25049,85,4,21,"Marshall: No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look."
25050,85,4,21,"Barney: The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything."""
25051,85,4,21,Marshall: The same he had with you the first time.
25052,85,4,21,Barney: We all know what it gave.
25053,85,4,21,Flashback
25054,85,4,21,Ted dances with Robin.
25055,85,4,21,Ted: I'm in love with you.
25056,85,4,21,Robin: What?
25057,85,4,21,End flashback
25058,85,4,21,"Robin: I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean."
25059,85,4,21,"Marshall: It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her."
25060,85,4,21,Barney: And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.
25061,85,4,21,Marshall: First: he jokes with the marriage.
25062,85,4,21,"Barney: ""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? """
25063,85,4,21,Marshall: Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.
25064,85,4,21,"Barney: ""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. """
25065,85,4,21,Marshall: Third: it says too early personal things.
25066,85,4,21,"Barney: ""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. """
25067,85,4,21,Robin: And he really knows not what means MDR.
25068,85,4,21,"Marshall: Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought."
25069,85,4,21,Barney: And then we met Stan.
25070,85,4,21,Flashback
25071,85,4,21,Marshall and Barney are still at the bar texting.
25072,85,4,21,Stan: Why do you so much noise?
25073,85,4,21,End flashback
25074,85,4,21,"Marshall: So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating."
25075,85,4,21,Flashback
25076,85,4,21,"Stan: Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug."
25077,85,4,21,End flashback
25078,85,4,21,Robin: Super Stan. Who is it?
25079,85,4,21,Barney: A guard who works nights.
25080,85,4,21,Marshall: He eats here every day.
25081,85,4,21,Barney: And he had not finished.
25082,85,4,21,Marshall: Far from it.
25083,85,4,21,Flashback
25084,85,4,21,"Stan: I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you."
25085,85,4,21,Marshall: It's... really nice.
25086,85,4,21,Barney: No matter. It's OK.
25087,85,4,21,
25088,85,4,21,Ted sits at the apartment to read a text message.
25089,85,4,21,"Holly: ""And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces. """
25090,85,4,21,Stan: Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now.
25091,85,4,21,Marshall: You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.
25092,85,4,21,"Holly: ""I do not ask someone to explain the night. I wait and it envelops me. And you're like bread, light and shadow. """
25093,85,4,21,Stan: This is Pablo Neruda.
25094,85,4,21,"Marshall: I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here."
25095,85,4,21,"Barney: Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you."
25096,85,4,21,Stan: That's cool. Still nothing?
25097,85,4,21,Marshall: It is perhaps not in love with us.
25098,85,4,21,Barney: How is this possible? It's all there waiting!
25099,85,4,21,Marshall: I do not understand men.
25100,85,4,21,Stan: I go to work.
25101,85,4,21,Marshall: Do... you come back?
25102,85,4,21,"Stan: I'll be back when the wind, destiny and luck will take me back. That is to say tomorrow. This is the day of the cheesesteak."
25103,85,4,21,End flashback
25104,85,4,21,Robin: That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?
25105,85,4,21,Barney: All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.
25106,85,4,21,"Robin: It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?"
25107,85,4,21,Barney: Yes. (Barney out of the bar) Or...
25108,85,4,21,Robin returned to the apartment.
25109,85,4,21,"Ted: Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now."
25110,85,4,21,Robin: Really? How she explained the scope of texting?
25111,85,4,21,"Ted: Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy."
25112,85,4,21,Robin: Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.
25113,85,4,21,"Ted: And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl."
25114,85,4,21,Robin: You cling to Barney and Marshall.
25115,85,4,21,Ted: What?
25116,85,4,21,"Robin: They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall."
25117,85,4,21,"Ted: Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?"
25118,85,4,21,Robin: I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.
25119,85,4,21,Ted: It's true.
25120,85,4,21,"Robin: Yes, it was them."
25121,85,4,21,Ted: Incredible!
25122,85,4,21,Robin: I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.
25123,85,4,21,Ted: Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.
25124,85,4,21,"Robin: I see. Why not: ""I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live""?"
25125,85,4,21,"Ted: Not bad. And: ""I killed a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface""?"
25126,85,4,21,Robin: I love this thing someone said about three months to live.
25127,85,4,21,"Ted: ""I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. """
25128,85,4,21,"Robin: It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live."
25129,85,4,21,Ted: Wait. I think I have.
25130,85,4,21,Marshall and Barney are in the latter's office.
25131,85,4,21,"Marshall: He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. """
25132,85,4,21,"Barney: That's it, man. This is the ""I love you."""
25133,85,4,21,Marshall: I would like Stan to be there.
25134,85,4,21,Barney: Stan. What?
25135,85,4,21,"Marshall: ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend."""
25136,85,4,21,"Barney: ""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. """
25137,85,4,21,"Marshall: Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?"
25138,85,4,21,Barney: Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.
25139,85,4,21,"Marshall: Dude, I'm his best friend."
25140,85,4,21,"Barney: Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state."
25141,85,4,21,"Marshall: That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do."
25142,85,4,21,Barney: I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.
25143,85,4,21,"Marshall: Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he époustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?"
25144,85,4,21,Barney: I know. It's weird.
25145,85,4,21,Barney and Marshall are in McClaren's with Robin.
25146,85,4,21,"Barney: Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay."
25147,85,4,21,"Marshall: And by ""me"", he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams."
25148,85,4,21,"Robin: So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?"
25149,85,4,21,Marshall: Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?
25150,85,4,21,"Ted: It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing."
25151,85,4,21,Barney: You can tell us. This is a secure area.
25152,85,4,21,Marshall: Your feelings are quite natural.
25153,85,4,21,Ted: That's what happened.
25154,85,4,21,"Ted (2030): And I wasted half an hour of life of these bastards, tell them about this dream where I dine with my top 5 best architects."
25155,85,4,21,"Ted: Then at the end of the meal, Frank Gehry addition to the slides and IM Pei said, ""Friend, tonight is your name I Paye.""Buckminster Fuller was almost choking. And I woke up."
25156,85,4,21,Marshall: That's it?
25157,85,4,21,Barney: No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?
25158,85,4,21,"Marshall: OK, what do you say that. You know that someday in the future, machines will rebel?"
25159,85,4,21,Ted: Of course.
25160,85,4,21,"Marshall: So, the machines... killed everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?"
25161,85,4,21,"Ted: And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?"
25162,85,4,21,Barney: Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.
25163,85,4,21,"Ted: It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?"
25164,85,4,21,Holly: I loved that he called me right away. It's very romantic.And I do not assoies home to read architectural magazines uniformed cheerleader. I do it naked.
25165,85,4,21,Ted: Holly and I are going to dinner.
25166,85,4,21,Holly: I'll meet you outside.
25167,85,4,21,Holly leaves the bar.
25168,85,4,21,Marshall: Sorry. It was just trying to help you.
25169,85,4,21,"Barney: And also, it was really funny."
25170,85,4,21,"Ted: I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an ""I""."
25171,85,4,21,"Ted (2030): I had proved that the Rule of Three Days was wrong and I went out to dinner with a pretty girl. And so far, I have told anyone the truth about this hot date."
25172,85,4,21,Ted is the restaurant with Holly.
25173,85,4,21,"Holly: It's funny! I also love indie music. We should get married. I laugh. Or not? I laugh again. That's it. We go to Brazil together! I saw my doctor this morning, he told me that everything was settled, so I can go. I think I love you."
25174,85,4,21,"Ted (2030): Finally, I did not have to wait three days, but Holly should really have. Like many rules, sometimes you follow them and sometimes not. But I will say this. When I was your mother's number, I called immediately."
25175,85,4,21,Marshall and Barney are at the bar with Stan when Robin arrives.
25176,85,4,21,"Stan: Hi, friends."
25177,85,4,21,Barney: You work right?
25178,85,4,21,Stan: I took leave.
25179,85,4,21,Marshall: Great! We can have fun!
25180,85,4,21,Stan: I can not. I have a date. Ready?
25181,85,4,21,Robin: Yes.
25182,85,4,21,Barney: What...
25183,85,4,21,Marshall: Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?
25184,85,4,21,"Barney: Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?"
25185,85,4,21,Stan: Friends. It's time to say goodbye. We all shared a special afternoon and it's something I cherish. I will never forget you.
25186,85,4,21,Robin by the arm of Stan.
25187,85,4,21,Robin: You know their names?
25188,85,4,21,"Stan: No. The large, this is Ted?"
25189,85,4,21,"Robin: No, it's Marshall. Married to Lily."
25190,85,4,21,Stan: OK. Do you like chicken wings?
25191,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): In May 2009, I was about to have my first big client as an independent architect. I was desperate for this to happen."
25192,86,4,22,Ted is in an office with two men.
25193,86,4,22,"Man: That's what you want, son. It's very simple. Opening a restaurant called Rib Town and it is to have the form... a cowboy hat."
25194,86,4,22,Ted (2030): Everything.
25195,86,4,22,"Ted: A hat? This is brilliant. I love it! Nothing better to say ""delicious"" as inside a cowboy hat. I tell you, I'm your man. I think being born to draw this building. I... I see."
25196,86,4,22,"Ted is in the apartment, slumped on his desk."
25197,86,4,22,Ted: I see it. I see it. (Robin enters) What is it good?
25198,86,4,22,Robin: All-Nighter?
25199,86,4,22,Ted: I told them I had a vision for this thing. They want a drawing in a week and I have nothing!
25200,86,4,22,Robin: It's cute.
25201,86,4,22,"Ted: Cute? I can draw concert halls and bridges. Bridges so beautiful they could be in museums. And I could draw these museums. But I draw, what instead? Where is my career? A two-story Stetson... with a terrace on the edge. It's a cosmic joke. The universe conspires against me."
25202,86,4,22,Robin: Did you just need to get out. Take a walk. Pay yourself a bagel.
25203,86,4,22,"Ted: Yeah, that'll solve everything. I have not slept for 34 hours, but a bagel is the answer. Cinnamon and raisin bagel with some cream. It looks good. I'll buy one."
25204,86,4,22,"Robin: Take an umbrella. It's going to rain, according Galoshes, our clown-weather."
25205,86,4,22,"Ted: Your show has a clown to present the weather? It's a bit nase, right?"
25206,86,4,22,"Robin: And this restaurant that you draw, what form it, Hoss?"
25207,86,4,22,"Ted: Okay. You want to fire me from here, I go out. I look forward to seeing what the universe has prepared me."
25208,86,4,22,"It takes an umbrella, left the apartment and then walking through the streets."
25209,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): Children, I tell you the story of meeting your mother. There is so much to learn from this story and it is most important. The greatest moments in life, it is not always what you do. This is also what happens to us. I'm not saying you can not influence the course of your life. You must act and you will. But remember that one day you could put one foot out and see your life changed forever. (He gives money to a homeless man) You know, the universe has a plan, children, and that plan is still moving. A butterfly flaps its wings... and it starts raining. (He opens his umbrella) It's scary. But it is also wonderful. All these workings of the machine running constantly, ensuring that you are exactly where you should be, exactly when you should be. The right place... (Someone taps him on the shoulder) at the right time."
25210,86,4,22,GENERIC
25211,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): Children, it's a miracle I've been at this corner.Especially since it would have been easy I'm not there."
25212,86,4,22,Flashback
25213,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): For example, when leaving the apartment, I almost go right instead of left. Why not right? For that, we must go back. As you know, your Aunt Robin had a show."
25214,86,4,22,"Robin: Eunice is itself these handbags. They are hand-embroidered silks at best. And each takes months to do. I can not say how long... (Robin threw in a bag) Weather, fools!"
25215,86,4,22,"Clown: Hi, everyone! A high pressure system arrives from the west..."
25216,86,4,22,Ted and Robin are in the apartment.
25217,86,4,22,"Robin: On the other hand, I bought a big bag today."
25218,86,4,22,"Ted: Wait, why did you vomit?"
25219,86,4,22,Robin: You want to know.
25220,86,4,22,Ted: Come on. Tell me.
25221,86,4,22,Robin: I'm pregnant.
25222,86,4,22,"Ted: I will raise this child with you. You're not alone. You can get married if you want, but I want to see other girls, it would be one of those marriages..."
25223,86,4,22,"Robin: Stop! I'm not pregnant. This is an intoxication. I ate something at the restaurant, three hours later, I vomited like a fountain."
25224,86,4,22,Ted: Where?
25225,86,4,22,Robin: This is a disgusting issue.
25226,86,4,22,Ted: Where was your meal?
25227,86,4,22,Robin: I want to tell you.
25228,86,4,22,Ted: What?
25229,86,4,22,"Barney, entering: Go to YouTube. Tape ""Robin Scherbatsky show vomit"". Robin, already gone."
25230,86,4,22,Robin: Someone has already put on YouTube?
25231,86,4,22,Barney: Yeah... someone. So... why did you vomit? You're pregnant?
25232,86,4,22,"Robin: Yeah, I'm pregnant."
25233,86,4,22,Barney runs off.
25234,86,4,22,Ted: Why do you not tell me where you got your intoxication?
25235,86,4,22,"Robin: You adore this place. If I tell you, it will ruin it."
25236,86,4,22,Ted: It makes sense. Do not say anything.
25237,86,4,22,Ted is in McClaren's with Robin.
25238,86,4,22,Ted: This Indian restaurant where the cat jumps on the tables?
25239,86,4,22,Robin: I say nothing.
25240,86,4,22,Ted: The Spanish restaurant with the cradle?
25241,86,4,22,Robin: I say nothing.
25242,86,4,22,The waitress brings a plate to Ted.
25243,86,4,22,Ted: Is it here? Tell me!
25244,86,4,22,Robin: You really want to know? This is Schlegel's Bagels.
25245,86,4,22,Ted: Why do you have told me? Schlegel's? Thank you! I'll have to find another New York place that serves bagels.
25246,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): The children, though as usual, I had gone to Schlegel's Bagels, I would have gone right. I would have taken a bagel would be returned to work on this building and you would perhaps never been born. But I went left, towards my second favorite place. And the rest is history. Of course, on the way, I stopped in this booth. Why I got arrested? That's why."
25247,86,4,22,Barney at the bar and reads a magazine. He returned to the apartment to see Ted.
25248,86,4,22,Barney: The Bro's Life magazine. Page 83. Look.
25249,86,4,22,"Ted: ""What does your paintball on your personality? """
25250,86,4,22,Barney: Lowest.
25251,86,4,22,"Ted: ""The last 3 kilos: how the push to lose. """
25252,86,4,22,Barney: Highest.
25253,86,4,22,Ted: Petra Petrova.
25254,86,4,22,"Barney: The Girl of the Year in May, according to Bro's Life magazine. A delicate flower in stiletto heel leopard thong and riding a 4x4."
25255,86,4,22,Ted: These magazines are broken. It is certainly retouched.
25256,86,4,22,Barney: I have an appointment with.
25257,86,4,22,Ted: You are my hero! Really? How did you do?
25258,86,4,22,Barney: It's not in the story. I waited a long time to say that.This girl... is the daughter.
25259,86,4,22,Ted: Of course it is. Marry them! It.
25260,86,4,22,"Barney: Marrying? I have something even more special in mind. Petra, if all goes well, will be my... wait, my 200th! Can not wait. Too exciting."
25261,86,4,22,Ted: The 200th with that... get laid?
25262,86,4,22,"Barney: Who I'll lie. I want the highest ""Tope there."""
25263,86,4,22,Ted: Even if I was wearing protective clothing. 200 is too much!
25264,86,4,22,"Barney: As if there could be too much of something wonderful.""Babe Ruth, gently, my grandfather. Do not hit too many home runs. Steve Guttenberg, you should not do that three Police Academy. America has laughed enough. """
25265,86,4,22,Ted: Who are these girls? It was rhetorical. Show me the list.
25266,86,4,22,"Barney: 199 satisfied customers. Finally, the big night is Thursday. I give a reception before, in McClaren's. Prepares a toast. Tuxedo optional but desired. Gifts are, I would say useless, but follow your heart."
25267,86,4,22,Ted: 200 is too much.
25268,86,4,22,Barney: It's not too much.
25269,86,4,22,Ted: That's too!
25270,86,4,22,"Barney, Marshall, Ted and Robin are at the bar."
25271,86,4,22,Marshall: It's not too much.
25272,86,4,22,Barney: Thank you.
25273,86,4,22,"Marshall: Do not misunderstand. You're disgusting and the cops should put a shoe on your part, but this number should be higher. After Barney told me about that, I reviewed the figures and... I have some graphics. Barney dredge about 20 girls a week."
25274,86,4,22,Barney: It's more than 20. B. Does nothing more precise estimate.
25275,86,4,22,"Marshall: Let 20. So 20 girls a week, that's 1,040 girls a year.In its 16 years of sexual activity, it would mean that he has dredged 16,640 girls. If he has slept with 199, it's a success rate... slightly higher than one per cent. This is an average of 12 hits, eight times worse than average in career... launcher in one hand, the launcher... Jim Abbott."
25276,86,4,22,"Barney: Jealous. Jealous. Hero. Strangely silent during this conversation on his number of sexual partners. Hero. The grand total, it is the only number that matters."
25277,86,4,22,Ted: Who said so?
25278,86,4,22,"Barney: Matthew Panning, the stud of Port Richmond College."
25279,86,4,22,Barney is in college.
25280,86,4,22,"Matthew: Stinson, you're an amateur. I bet you've never done."
25281,86,4,22,Barney: You neither.
25282,86,4,22,Matthew: How many times I have to tell you? I did it with 100 girls. Fifth in school from my cousin in Long Island.
25283,86,4,22,"Barney: You know what, Matthew? One day, I would have done with 200."
25284,86,4,22,Matthew: Call me when it happens.
25285,86,4,22,Barney: And I'll call.
25286,86,4,22,Ted: I think he'll say it again very slowly.
25287,86,4,22,Barney: I will... the call.
25288,86,4,22,"Robin: You have noted Gaby Allan dual, 78 and 162."
25289,86,4,22,"Barney: What? Let me see. Sixty... Once. Oh, my God. Wait...I counted the same girl twice? That means I'm only at 198?"
25290,86,4,22,Marshall: It just means you're less than 0.5% was thought disgusting.
25291,86,4,22,Barney: I win a Czech supermodel in two hours. I can not waste it in the 199th. Petra must be the 200th.
25292,86,4,22,Ted: are you gonna do? You will find not a partner in the next 2 hours.
25293,86,4,22,Barney: Astronaut Millionaire. You come home to see shells?
25294,86,4,22,Woman 1: Get out.
25295,86,4,22,Barney: I come from the grave of my wife. I buried her there was just one year. I miss her. I need comfort.
25296,86,4,22,Woman 2: You're scary.
25297,86,4,22,Barney: You're not as sick of all these games? I just want to settle down and have an army of toddlers at once.
25298,86,4,22,Woman 3: I have a mass and I love to use it.
25299,86,4,22,"Barney: Marshall? Knowing how important it is for me, you think that Lily... I would do the job..."
25300,86,4,22,Marshall: I'll kill you.
25301,86,4,22,Barney: Okay.
25302,86,4,22,Barney leaves the bar. Ted finds himself alone with Robin.
25303,86,4,22,Ted: Where did Barney? It's been over an hour.
25304,86,4,22,"Robin: You know, looking at the names on this list, I do not see a lot of ethnic diversity. It should really be questioned."
25305,86,4,22,Barney returns.
25306,86,4,22,"Barney: It's done. 199 made of, more than one. Have you finished your drink? (He takes the ice in the glass of Ted and puts them under the table) That's better."
25307,86,4,22,Ted: It has happened to you what?
25308,86,4,22,Barney: There... a girl in the gym. Pauline. She runs after me for a while.
25309,86,4,22,Ted: Why wait till then?
25310,86,4,22,Barney: It's not really my type.
25311,86,4,22,
25312,86,4,22,At the gym...
25313,86,4,22,"Barney: Good, Pauline. You're going to have all of Fonte Leveuse Sarasota Classic this fall. I thought... to you and me.And if you're still interested..."
25314,86,4,22,"Pauline: Ok, this is the hour of cardio."
25315,86,4,22,Barney: Good grief! Mom!
25316,86,4,22,"Barney: Every inch tasted like roast beef and creatine. But I did. I did and I still have 30 minutes before meeting with Petra.Robin, you have the foundation? I want to cover bruises and razor burn."
25317,86,4,22,"Robin: I hate to tell you this, but..."
25318,86,4,22,Barney: What?
25319,86,4,22,"Robin: You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice."
25320,86,4,22,"Barney: So that means... Pauline is not the 199th, it is the 200th?"
25321,86,4,22,Ted: Congratulations!
25322,86,4,22,"Barney: It must have Petra! Petra was to be the 200th!Beautiful, feminine, ""unrestrained power in bed"", Petra!"
25323,86,4,22,"Ted: Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines."
25324,86,4,22,"Barney: It does. She will be in the next Muscle Sexxy. And like many women in this magazine, Sexxy has two X and one Y."
25325,86,4,22,End flashback
25326,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): So, bagel on the way, I stopped a minute in a booth to see the photo of the 200th Barney. If I had not done that, I would have missed the cut by the booth and came 77th in this corner a minute earlier. I would have had the bagel, worked a little, and you children, you would not be born. Why I cut through the 77th and gave a dollar to the homeless? That's why. In the early days of Marshall to Goliath National Bank..."
25327,86,4,22,Flashback
25328,86,4,22,"Marshall: Fran, I will not bother you, but I have a presentation tomorrow and it would help me if I could have tables and graphs. Can you help me?"
25329,86,4,22,"Fran: This is the graphics department. We can make all the graphs, tables, in all colors on the paper you want."
25330,86,4,22,"Marshall: We'll have fun. (At the bar...) I ranked the presidents in order of disloyalty. A: Johnson. Two: Bush. Three Harding.Four: Polk. (At the apartment...) This circle represents ""Those who break my heart."" And this circle represents ""Those who constantly undermine my confidence. ""And where they meet: Cecilia. (Back at the bar...) This is a pie chart describing my favorite bars. And that is a graph describing my favorite pies.(Ted, Barney and Robin Marshall waiting for a response) What is it?"
25331,86,4,22,Robin: That's enough tables.
25332,86,4,22,Barney: What about the graphics.
25333,86,4,22,Ted: Any visual representation of data.
25334,86,4,22,"Marshall: I'm not stupid. I know what you think of my paintings and graphics. In fact, I made a picture of your reactions to my paintings. See it. Yes, that's true, since Cecilia, your interest in my paintings do not stop falling. But based on recent trends, I also... projection boards! And look... a large peak of interest is coming! And it's not just a blip dead cat. It is a long-term growth."
25335,86,4,22,"Barney: It's you, sustained growth."
25336,86,4,22,Marshall is at work in the meeting room.
25337,86,4,22,"Marshall: So, I prepared some charts to show how the setting up of a shell company in Bermuda could minimize our losses in the second quarter. And you avoid jail. To begin with...Excuse me a moment?"
25338,86,4,22,Marshall leaves the room. Ted is in the apartment when her phone rings.
25339,86,4,22,Ted: Mosbius Designs.
25340,86,4,22,Marshall: What happened to my pictures?
25341,86,4,22,Ted: They were thrown.
25342,86,4,22,Marshall: What?
25343,86,4,22,"Ted: That's an intervention. You could not stop eating, so we threw your cam."
25344,86,4,22,"Marshall: Come on, Ted! I need my pictures! Only for today and I promise to never ever do. I suffered a lot of pressure. I need my paintings, Jack!"
25345,86,4,22,Ted: You make tables work?
25346,86,4,22,"Marshall: It's for work, idiot! I make a great show and if I have not these pictures, I'm gonna get fired!"
25347,86,4,22,Ted: Damn. Not move. I bring them.
25348,86,4,22,"Marshall: Magne! I will research how to wait. (Marshall back in the room) Sorry, there is a little late with the tables. But we'll begin in a moment. Fish are weird, right? I mean, what's their problem?"
25349,86,4,22,Ted looking in garbage cans.
25350,86,4,22,Voice: Tables! Buy your tables!
25351,86,4,22,"Ted: I'm sorry, Milt? I think these are my paintings."
25352,86,4,22,Milt: These tables? On my coverage?
25353,86,4,22,Ted: This is my blanket. We'll see later. But I need these tables.
25354,86,4,22,Milt: Good thing they are selling.
25355,86,4,22,"Ted: Okay, how?"
25356,86,4,22,Milt: One million.
25357,86,4,22,Ted: I give you five dollars.
25358,86,4,22,Milt: One million.
25359,86,4,22,Ted: No one will pay a million for these pictures!
25360,86,4,22,Milt: One million.
25361,86,4,22,"Ted: OK, Milt, you won. I will give one million."
25362,86,4,22,Milt: I'm urine...
25363,86,4,22,Ted: The problem is that the distributor...
25364,86,4,22,Milt: The alien time machine...
25365,86,4,22,Ted: The alien time machine has a withdrawal limit. That's what I'll do. I give you a dollar... per day... for a million days.
25366,86,4,22,Milt: It's... It's been 2700 years. It works! (Ted gives him a ticket and take the pictures) Big nase.
25367,86,4,22,"Marshall: Sorry, there is a star of earth? (Ted comes into the meeting room with tables) start."
25368,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): If I had not bought these tables for Marshall, I would not be passed by the 77th to give Milt his dollar. In short, you know the rest. And now, children. There are lots of little reasons that great things happen to us. If I knew then that these things take me and how I shall be grateful to them, I probably would have done something like that."
25369,86,4,22,"(Ted restarts in the sense that he came and took Milt in his arms, and others. Sometimes the bar where Barney reads a magazine and also takes in his arms. Then the room Sprot, in Schlegel's Bagels, to work with Robin) Because at the end, I landed in the right place at the right time. And with that, my life has never been the same."
25370,86,4,22,He tapped on the shoulder and when he turns he finds Stella by his side.
25371,86,4,22,End flashback
25372,86,4,22,Barney is in McClaren's.
25373,86,4,22,"Ted (2030): The next day, Uncle Barney finally confronted Matthew Panning, the stud of the school of Port Richmond."
25374,86,4,22,"Matthew Barney, glad news, it's been a while. What's new?"
25375,86,4,22,Barney: I slept with 200 women.
25376,86,4,22,Matthew: My God! This is too much. Finally... It's disgusting.Have you thought of consulting as a s*x addict? You're the perfect candidate.
25377,86,4,22,"Barney: You've thought of consulting as ""I win, you lose""?Suddenly, your 100 girls in fifth, it is so impressive."
25378,86,4,22,Matthew: 100 girls? This is what it is? I lied!
25379,86,4,22,Barney: Of course.
25380,86,4,22,"Matthew: I was 12, I was lying of course. I had no Ewok companion."
25381,86,4,22,Barney: Of course.
25382,86,4,22,Matthew: Your adult life is built on... something... on which I lied to 12?
25383,86,4,22,Barney: Jealous?
25384,86,4,22,"Matthew: I get my kids to school. Looks like you got a lot of problems. Good luck, I guess."
25385,86,4,22,Matthew Barney left hand alone.
25386,86,4,22,Barney: I'm awesome. 200. Now what?
25387,86,4,22,Robin is also the bar.
25388,87,4,23,Ted is on the sidewalk with his umbrella.
25389,87,4,23,"Ted (2030): Children, Stella was the girl I thought to end my life. Before she left me on the altar, breaking my heart. So, when I cross seven months later, I had only one thing to say."
25390,87,4,23,Ted: Stella! Glad to see you again!
25391,87,4,23,Stella: I do too.
25392,87,4,23,Ted: And Tony! What a nice surprise.
25393,87,4,23,"Marshall, Barney, Robin and Ted are in McClaren's."
25394,87,4,23,"Robin: ""What a nice surprise""? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do?"
25395,87,4,23,Ted: We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths.
25396,87,4,23,"Robin: You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right?"
25397,87,4,23,Marshall and Barney gets up applauding.
25398,87,4,23,"Barney: Well played, sir."
25399,87,4,23,Marshall: Well done.
25400,87,4,23,Robin: What?
25401,87,4,23,"Marshall: You know, Ted has played cool, that's exactly what he should do. In fact, I would say on a scale of..."
25402,87,4,23,"Ted, crying: And I kept your sweater... and sometimes, I sit in the bathtub for hours, you know, feel it."
25403,87,4,23,Marshall:... up...
25404,87,4,23,"Ted, with a lookalike Stella: It's my new bride. This is Stella, except that it is French and, as you see, she has enormous breasts."
25405,87,4,23,Lookalike Stella: Magic.
25406,87,4,23,Tony: Enchanted.
25407,87,4,23,Marshall: I think you've been great.
25408,87,4,23,"Barney: I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. ""Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? ""Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake ""Tope-there""."
25409,87,4,23,Ted: I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future.
25410,87,4,23,"Ted (2030): And you know, I meant it. But anyway, that night, my mind wandered."
25411,87,4,23,Ted thinks we knocks on his door. It will open to find Stella.
25412,87,4,23,Stella: I made a terrible mistake.
25413,87,4,23,Ted: I know. I'm better than you.
25414,87,4,23,Stella: Bluntly. Ressortons lie down together and much more.
25415,87,4,23,Ted: Sold!
25416,87,4,23,They kiss.
25417,87,4,23,Ted was at the apartment and think a knock at his door.
25418,87,4,23,"Tony: Hi, Ted."
25419,87,4,23,GENERIC
25420,87,4,23,"Ted: No, between. It's not weird at all."
25421,87,4,23,Tony will lie on the sofa.
25422,87,4,23,"Tony: I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad."
25423,87,4,23,Ted: Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.
25424,87,4,23,"Tony: You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag."
25425,87,4,23,Ted: Why are you here?
25426,87,4,23,"Tony: I know I can be a bit harsh, but I can not bear to have you as many wounded. Fate put me in the street to fix it.Obviously, I can not fill the crater left by Stella in your heart."
25427,87,4,23,Ted: I met lots of girls.
25428,87,4,23,Tony: And I know you've been fired.
25429,87,4,23,Ted: I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy.
25430,87,4,23,"Tony: No. Ted, my family has a lot of money. And I want to use that money to fix it with you."
25431,87,4,23,At the bar...
25432,87,4,23,Marshall: Tony is rich? Tell me that you wrote a check. Tell me that you did a very big check. So big that he not remove his shirt to go swimming.
25433,87,4,23,"Barney: It's a very big check. IF big, that if you sleep with, you would not tell your friends."
25434,87,4,23,Marshall: It's a very big check.
25435,87,4,23,"Robin: So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats."
25436,87,4,23,Marshall: It's...
25437,87,4,23,Barney: A very big check!
25438,87,4,23,Ted: Yeah! He has not signed a check.
25439,87,4,23,Flashback
25440,87,4,23,"Tony: Ted, I want to offer you a job."
25441,87,4,23,Ted: A job?
25442,87,4,23,"Tony: Every year, my family gives a lot to Columbia University, I have contacts. How would you like to design..."
25443,87,4,23,Ted (2030): My heart jumped. A new library? A conservatory?
25444,87,4,23,Tony:... your own resume as professor of architecture.
25445,87,4,23,Ted: No thank you.
25446,87,4,23,End flashback
25447,87,4,23,"Marshall: What do you mean ""no thank you""? You'd be a great teacher. You are an expert, you can talk, and when necessary, you can get to grow a beautiful beard."
25448,87,4,23,"Ted: I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic."
25449,87,4,23,"Barney: Okay. Today, I had a $ 200 fine for speeding."
25450,87,4,23,"Marshall: That sucks, dude. You did not manage to blow it up?"
25451,87,4,23,Barney: You can not blow a fine.
25452,87,4,23,Marshall: I have done. It was... when? In 1998.
25453,87,4,23,Flashback
25454,87,4,23,"Minnesota 1998, Marshall was arrested by a policeman."
25455,87,4,23,Policeman: Where's the fire?
25456,87,4,23,"Marshall: There is no fire. In fact, you know, there's a fire in the barbecue where I go. Nothing special. Burgers, chops...merguez."
25457,87,4,23,"Policeman: You know it's dangerous to go... You said ""sausages""?"
25458,87,4,23,"Marshall: Yeah, merguez. My mother's marinated in beer for 2 days. That's it. It's weird, I could have sworn that what those big, succulent smoked sausages had writing on it. Bizarre.You were saying?"
25459,87,4,23,Policeman: That was writing what? The merguez?
25460,87,4,23,"Marshall: It said: ""Ownership of Minnesota police, Jorgensen.""You like merguez, Jorgensen agent?"
25461,87,4,23,Policeman: You go to this address? Follow me with the siren.It will burn red lights.
25462,87,4,23,End flashback
25463,87,4,23,"Barney: I would have done that too, if I went to a barbecue.Slim, I went there."
25464,87,4,23,Marshall: It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster.
25465,87,4,23,Robin: Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.
25466,87,4,23,"Barney: You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait."
25467,87,4,23,"Ted: I understand. ""Ack-Ted. ""I understood."
25468,87,4,23,At the apartment...
25469,87,4,23,Ted: What now?
25470,87,4,23,Tony: You wanna be an architect? Super. A guy I was in school wants a new home. The job is yours if you want.
25471,87,4,23,"Ted: Tony, I do not need your help."
25472,87,4,23,Tony: That's his job.
25473,87,4,23,Ted: Now that's a very big check.
25474,87,4,23,Barney is driving his car.
25475,87,4,23,Barney: Let's go.
25476,87,4,23,Police: Driver and vehicle registration.
25477,87,4,23,"Barney: Of course, officer. On."
25478,87,4,23,"Policeman: Sir, this is a gift certificate for a custom Italian suit."
25479,87,4,23,"Barney: So, what's good?"
25480,87,4,23,Barney arrives at the bar.
25481,87,4,23,Barney: $ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch.
25482,87,4,23,"Robin: You're wrong about that, man."
25483,87,4,23,"Barney: Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine."
25484,87,4,23,Marshall: Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had.
25485,87,4,23,Robin: This is outrageous! And relevant.
25486,87,4,23,Flashback
25487,87,4,23,"Robin in tears, stopped by a policeman."
25488,87,4,23,"Policeman: Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK?"
25489,87,4,23,Robin: Thank you.
25490,87,4,23,End flashback
25491,87,4,23,Barney: Excuse me. I left something in New Jersey.
25492,87,4,23,He gets up and leaves the bar when Ted arrived.
25493,87,4,23,Robin: How was your lunch with the rich? It started well.
25494,87,4,23,Flashback
25495,87,4,23,Ted is a man with Tony.
25496,87,4,23,"Ted: I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall..."
25497,87,4,23,"Man: Yes, that's fine. You will do a good job. My concern is the basement. Especially the laundry."
25498,87,4,23,Ted: The laundry room?
25499,87,4,23,"Man: I want a laundry room of 5 x 5 meters, ceramic tiles stain-resistant floor to ceiling. I am a man who likes to do his own laundry, and sometimes it's messy."
25500,87,4,23,End flashback
25501,87,4,23,Marshall: Gruesome?
25502,87,4,23,Ted: Gruesome.
25503,87,4,23,Flashback
25504,87,4,23,Man: steel chains hanging from the ceiling 3 meters. This is where my bags of laundry will be hung for three days and three nights before I... cleans.
25505,87,4,23,End flashback
25506,87,4,23,"Robin: Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design..."
25507,87,4,23,Ted: A deadly house.
25508,87,4,23,Robin: That's it. A house of horror.
25509,87,4,23,Flashback
25510,87,4,23,"Tony: By practicing martial arts, I learned to believe in my instinct and my instinct tells me that... it sounds great."
25511,87,4,23,Ted: The steak is very rare.
25512,87,4,23,End flashback
25513,87,4,23,Marshall jumps up.
25514,87,4,23,Ted: Do not you?
25515,87,4,23,Flashback
25516,87,4,23,"Man: One last point, soundproofing. I tend to make much noise when I wash. I'll show you. I'll go in the laundry room and tell me if you hear me."
25517,87,4,23,The man left the table.
25518,87,4,23,"Ted: It's a bit serious, huh?"
25519,87,4,23,Tony: Grave well. You hit the nail.
25520,87,4,23,End flashback
25521,87,4,23,Robin: You can not do this house!
25522,87,4,23,Ted: I will not do.
25523,87,4,23,Marshall: You can not do it!
25524,87,4,23,Ted: I will not do it!
25525,87,4,23,
25526,87,4,23,"While the others are at the bar, Barney is in his car and is still off."
25527,87,4,23,"Barney: Come on. Mr. Officer, please, my wife is having a baby! She just lost the waters!"
25528,87,4,23,Policeman: Where is your wife?
25529,87,4,23,"Barney: She took the other car. It's Italian leather, so... I... go..."
25530,87,4,23,Ted is in McClaren's with Tony.
25531,87,4,23,"Tony: Sorry for this house of horror. It was my fault. It is for me.New plan. My friend, you will build a husband to the Statue of Liberty. I have some knowledge in the town hall."
25532,87,4,23,"Ted: Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that."
25533,87,4,23,Tony: Yes
25534,87,4,23,Ted: Why?
25535,87,4,23,"Tony: Because... when you were with Stella, I missed her terribly. I can imagine how you feel."
25536,87,4,23,"Ted: Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy."
25537,87,4,23,Tony: Okay. A weight less.
25538,87,4,23,"Ted (2030): And that was all. Tony is gone and I started to put it all behind me. Finally, I thought."
25539,87,4,23,A knock at the apartment again.
25540,87,4,23,Ted: Stella?
25541,87,4,23,Stella: Tony left me.
25542,87,4,23,Ted: Tony left you?
25543,87,4,23,Stella: He said it was because of what you said.
25544,87,4,23,"Robin: You did break Tony and Stella? Really sorry, but I must insist that you topes there."
25545,87,4,23,Ted: Let's talk in the hallway.
25546,87,4,23,Robin: I'll wait.
25547,87,4,23,Ted closes the door behind him.
25548,87,4,23,Ted: Why are you here?
25549,87,4,23,"Stella: Look, Ted, I was 7 months late, but that's how. I'm in love with Tony, since high school. We went out for a long time, and then... I became pregnant and for a 19 year old daughter, it was too much to handle, and it broke. And for a long time, I too thought about my role as mother. I forgot Tony. I forgot...what it was like being in love. Then you came and everything was resurrected. And I loved you for that. I loved you so much, in fact, it was just... enough. But I always liked Tony."
25550,87,4,23,"Woman, leaving her: Take it back on, darling. He's sorry."
25551,87,4,23,"Ted: No, it's not what happens. Tuck, Mrs. Matsen. Delighted to have you review, Stella."
25552,87,4,23,Stella: Can you talk to Tony?
25553,87,4,23,Ted: What?
25554,87,4,23,Stella: He'll listen. You made him change his mind. You can do it again. It is cruel to ask that...
25555,87,4,23,"Ted: Yes, it's cruel to ask it."
25556,87,4,23,Stella: I do not know what else to do. I love it.
25557,87,4,23,"Ted: You love her? What, you do call my romance? It's your strategy? Because this guy is gone. You can have me over like that. I am attached to nothing, thanks to you."
25558,87,4,23,"Ms. Matsen: Come on, darling, kiss me!"
25559,87,4,23,"Stella, shouting: Tuck, Mrs. Matsen!"
25560,87,4,23,Ted: Enter!
25561,87,4,23,Barney is stopped on the roadside.
25562,87,4,23,"Barney: OK, you can do it. You can do it! You can do it."
25563,87,4,23,Police: Driver and...
25564,87,4,23,Barney: Licensing and registration papers.
25565,87,4,23,Police: Pardon?
25566,87,4,23,Barney: You must have a permit to be as pretty. And this body? I imagine that something as explosive must be registered with the authorities.
25567,87,4,23,It makes it a snap.
25568,87,4,23,Police: Exit the vehicle.
25569,87,4,23,"Barney: Why, am I under arrest?"
25570,87,4,23,Police: No. It depends on what you will do me.
25571,87,4,23,"Barney, Marshall and Robin were at the bar."
25572,87,4,23,Robin: False. This has never happened.
25573,87,4,23,"Marshall: It's from a porno. I saw him. sh1t, I did."
25574,87,4,23,Barney: When will you understand the difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting.
25575,87,4,23,Robin: You're lying.
25576,87,4,23,Barney: I'm not lying! I swear on my mother. I swear Goliath National Bank. I swear on my costumes. I... do... mens... not.
25577,87,4,23,Ted (2030): He lied. That's what really happened.
25578,87,4,23,Flashback
25579,87,4,23,"Ms. Matsen: Come on, darling, kiss me!"
25580,87,4,23,"Stella: Tuck, Mrs. Matsen!"
25581,87,4,23,Ted: Enter!
25582,87,4,23,Stella: I can not do anything to fix everything?
25583,87,4,23,Ted: No.
25584,87,4,23,Ted's phone rings.
25585,87,4,23,Barney: It's me! This is Barney. With the help! I have big problems!
25586,87,4,23,Ted: Slow down. What's going on?
25587,87,4,23,Barney: I imagine that something as explosive must be registered with the authorities.
25588,87,4,23,Police: Get out.
25589,87,4,23,"Barney: Why, am I under arrest?"
25590,87,4,23,"Police: Yes, I did a search. You have 15 offenses of the past three days. Exit the vehicle."
25591,87,4,23,"Barney: No, my wife will give birth! I have a sausage with your name!"
25592,87,4,23,Police: Get out!
25593,87,4,23,"Barney: You must come to Brazzaville, in New Jersey to take me out."
25594,87,4,23,Ted: I'm a little busy.
25595,87,4,23,Barney: Come on. You have no idea what kind of criminals with whom they put me.
25596,87,4,23,Boy: Let's get our painting?
25597,87,4,23,"Barney: Save me, Ted!"
25598,87,4,23,Ted hangs up.
25599,87,4,23,Ted: You wanna do something for me? I have to go in New Jersey.
25600,87,4,23,"Stella: You pay the toll, eh? I laugh."
25601,87,4,23,"Ted (2030): So, Stella and I went to New Jersey, to release your uncle Barney and we went home."
25602,87,4,23,Stella in the car...
25603,87,4,23,"Barney: By the way, how's the girl you see? This superb French with huge tits?"
25604,87,4,23,Ted: You talk about Claudette? She is fine.
25605,87,4,23,Barney: The highest good of all those with whom you're never out! Ever!
25606,87,4,23,"Barney out of the car, leaving Ted and Stella both."
25607,87,4,23,"Stella: Again, sorry for everything. Actually..."
25608,87,4,23,Ted: I talk to Tony.
25609,87,4,23,Stella: Really?
25610,87,4,23,Ted: I want you to be happy. I will speak to him.
25611,87,4,23,"Ted (2030): And I did. I know what I told him, but he had to change his mind because the next day they went to California.Stella opened a new office. And against all odds, Tony became a successful writer. His film, ""The Bride"" was a hit. But we will come back."
25612,87,4,23,"Ted: Just tell me one thing. Why Tony? I mean, it's money, pajamas kung fu? Finally... What is it?"
25613,87,4,23,Stella: That is correct.
25614,87,4,23,Ted: Good.
25615,87,4,23,"Stella: It's a little silly, but yes."
25616,87,4,23,"Ted: I will say out loud something that I had managed not to say out loud. Have you, Tony and you... That at one point I thought I had with you... I know that Marshall and Lily... I want that. I want to. I keep waiting and waiting for that to happen and... I guess I'm just... tired of waiting. And that's all I have to say about it."
25617,87,4,23,Stella: I've already told you that I avoided a PV?
25618,87,4,23,Ted: Really?
25619,87,4,23,"Stella: I was at my parents by doing 130 and I was arrested.The cop comes out of his car. He struts around a bit to me like, ""Girl, I've waited all day. ""Then I looked and I said,"" Sorry, Mr. Officer. I came as fast as I could. """
25620,87,4,23,Ted: Really?
25621,87,4,23,"Stella: An old joke. I know you're tired of waiting and may require you to wait a little longer, but it happens, Ted. And it happens as fast as she can."
25622,87,4,23,"Ted drops to turn the car, and watches her go."
25623,87,4,23,In McClaren's...
25624,87,4,23,"Barney: She was found two days later, in the directory. I've never put my name in my underwear."
25625,87,4,23,Lily joined them.
25626,87,4,23,Barney: You're back!
25627,87,4,23,"Lily: When listening to this joke of peanut butter and jam, I was completely disgusted. But this morning in the shower, I thought about it and it made me laugh. Peanut butter. So I think I could win. According to Marshall."
25628,87,4,23,"Barney: It's good to see you, Lily."
25629,87,4,23,Lily: Thank you. So what's new?
25630,87,4,23,Barney: I'm in a world of amnesia with lots of pictures of my son and an alliance. I will find the best woman / woman and we will...
25631,87,4,23,"Lily: OK, that's enough for tonight. I'll go slowly."
25632,87,4,23,Lily leaves.
25633,88,4,24,Ted (2030): Each architect has a building that changed his career. For me it was to my 31st birthday. It was not a museum or a concert hall or a skyscraper. It was something else.
25634,88,4,24,"Man: We opened a restaurant called the Rib Town, we want it shaped..."
25635,88,4,24,The band of friends is to McClaren's.
25636,88,4,24,"Ted:... hat cowboy. Listen, I need this job. I have no other option."
25637,88,4,24,Robin: You can always do prof.
25638,88,4,24,"Ted: I have not worked as hard to finish in a crappy job. Get me wrong, Lily."
25639,88,4,24,Lily: I was pissed 3 times this morning. I can not say.
25640,88,4,24,"Ted: I pass this building, so I see you in three days."
25641,88,4,24,He leaves the bar to go home and get to drawing.
25642,88,4,24,"Ted (2030): The next three days, I worked as ever. And it led me... nowhere."
25643,88,4,24,Barney enters the apartment where Ted is still trying to design a building.
25644,88,4,24,Barney: What are you doing?
25645,88,4,24,Ted: A hat-shaped building.
25646,88,4,24,Barney: It's time to talk?
25647,88,4,24,Ted: No.
25648,88,4,24,Barney: What do you think of Robin?
25649,88,4,24,"Ted: I have to really work, so..."
25650,88,4,24,"Barney: Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume."
25651,88,4,24,Ted: Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.
25652,88,4,24,"Barney: But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?"
25653,88,4,24,Ted: I'm with you.
25654,88,4,24,Barney: Now. For I have explained.
25655,88,4,24,Ted: What...
25656,88,4,24,Ted Barney greenhouse in his arms.
25657,88,4,24,GENERIC
25658,88,4,24,"Marshall: Come on, man, you're on it for three days without stopping. This is your birthday. Come have a beer on the roof."
25659,88,4,24,"Ted: Impossible, the presentation is tomorrow. These hats are not alone."
25660,88,4,24,Marshall: That's a big restaurant for tourists. Just put wide doors and chairs strengthened. Birthday beer on the roof. Let's go!
25661,88,4,24,Ted: Why do you want as I go on the roof? You made me a surprise party?
25662,88,4,24,"Marshall: What? We brought you a surprise party, last year.Thou shalt have no surprises on two holidays. The fact that the world has come to the first was surprising. Not? Two surprises on Christmas! It is very strong! It is very strong! Great!(Marshall goes on the roof) Super... It still will not mount."
25663,88,4,24,Robin: Come on. This is boring! I knew it was a bad idea.
25664,88,4,24,"Marshall: Yes, Robin, I know. This festival is... is... a disaster.It was my idea. I take responsibility. There is one thing to do."
25665,88,4,24,"Lily: Marshall, no."
25666,88,4,24,"Marshall: Lily, I have to! (He stands on the edge of the roof) It's useless to procrastinate."
25667,88,4,24,Ted (2030): I should explain. A few years earlier...
25668,88,4,24,Flashback
25669,88,4,24,"Ted, Marshall and Barney are on the roof with an inflatable pool."
25670,88,4,24,"Barney: Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks."
25671,88,4,24,Marshall: You know who knows how to live? These people.
25672,88,4,24,Ted (2030): The terrace of the building next door. A paradise waiting for us behind a pit of 2 or 3 meters. And the best...
25673,88,4,24,Marshall: It looks to be a... sacred... spa.
25674,88,4,24,Barney: Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump?
25675,88,4,24,Marshall mounted on the edge of the roof.
25676,88,4,24,Marshall: I can jump it.
25677,88,4,24,"Ted: Recently, you need two tries to get up from the couch.You can not skip it."
25678,88,4,24,Marshall: Really?
25679,88,4,24,Ted: Really.
25680,88,4,24,Marshall: Look.
25681,88,4,24,Ted (2030): But he did not jump.
25682,88,4,24,An hour later... Marshall is always on the edge of the roof while Ted and Barney are in the pool.
25683,88,4,24,"Barney: Actually, it's not bad."
25684,88,4,24,Ted: Right?
25685,88,4,24,"Ted (2030): And the following years, he continued to try. But each time, without exception... He did not jump."
25686,88,4,24,End flashback
25687,88,4,24,"Marshall: Do not worry. If I can jump tonight, it will save the evening."
25688,88,4,24,"Lily: Honey, come down here, please."
25689,88,4,24,"Marshall: When Evel Knievel rode his rocket star on the shore of Snake River Canyon, you think his wife said ""Honey, come down here '?"
25690,88,4,24,"Lily: For the last time, I'm not Linda Knievel! I will never be Linda Knievel!"
25691,88,4,24,Marshall: No need to remind me.
25692,88,4,24,Ted is still on the drawing of his building.
25693,88,4,24,"Lily: Marshall, do not do that. Do not jump, please."
25694,88,4,24,"Marshall: Sorry, but I have to."
25695,88,4,24,Lily: You can not.
25696,88,4,24,Marshall: Why?
25697,88,4,24,Lily: You want a reason? You're going to have one. I am pregnant.
25698,88,4,24,"Marshall: My God! My God, really? I saw you look fat..."
25699,88,4,24,"Lily: I was lying, b*st*rd! Go ahead, jump! I hope u gonna die!"
25700,88,4,24,Marshall: This is the permission I needed.
25701,88,4,24,"Barney: Look, Robin... I must tell you something."
25702,88,4,24,"Robin: Wait. Before that, I must tell you something."
25703,88,4,24,Barney: What is it?
25704,88,4,24,Robin: I think I love you.
25705,88,4,24,Ted is a goat in her kitchen. Marshall is still on the edge of the roof when the phone rings from Lily.
25706,88,4,24,"Lily: This is Ted. Everyone! Ted, are you?"
25707,88,4,24,"Ted: She's here, Lily. She looks at me."
25708,88,4,24,Lily: What?
25709,88,4,24,Ted: The goat.
25710,88,4,24,Ted (2030): I have already told you some of the history of the goat.
25711,88,4,24,Fash-back
25712,88,4,24,"Ted (2030): When Aunt Lily a farmer invited to speak to his class how he brought the goat, and told the class what he would do later. How Aunt Lily, in a fit of kindness, bought a goat to commute his sentence."
25713,88,4,24,End flashback
25714,88,4,24,"Barney: It's been an incredible thing. I was talking to Robin, I would tell him my feelings, but just before, you will believe what ever she said."

25716,88,4,24,Robin: I think I love you.
25717,88,4,24,End flashback
25718,88,4,24,Lily: You said what?
25719,88,4,24,Barney: In your opinion? What we can say to that?
25720,88,4,24,Flashback
25721,88,4,24,"Barney: Robin, you're great listening. You're really great, but we're friends. This is not a good idea."
25722,88,4,24,Robin: You must be right. Have fun.
25723,88,4,24,"Barney: You too, sweetie."
25724,88,4,24,End flashback
25725,88,4,24,Lily: What?
25726,88,4,24,"Barney: Once she told me that, more than feelings. I'm more in love."
25727,88,4,24,"Lily: You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more."
25728,88,4,24,Barney: It's not great?
25729,88,4,24,Ted draws again and again while the goat eats a cloth.
25730,88,4,24,Ted: It's a wuss. Not food. (He takes the mop in the bathroom and closes the door behind him) How...?
25731,88,4,24,"On the roof, Marshall is still trying to jump from the roof terrace managed to go next door."
25732,88,4,24,Marshall: It is. It... is... go! It is.
25733,88,4,24,"Barney: Tracey, tell Lily what you just said."
25734,88,4,24,Tracey: What I just arrived in New York?
25735,88,4,24,"Barney: No, how you've arrived there."
25736,88,4,24,Tracey: I just get off the bus from Iowa.
25737,88,4,24,Barney: Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?
25738,88,4,24,Tracey: I believe in a classic story of showbiz.
25739,88,4,24,"Lily: Honey, you're there. You're really there."
25740,88,4,24,"Barney: You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?"
25741,88,4,24,Tracey: Of course!
25742,88,4,24,Lily: Damn.
25743,88,4,24,Barney: What?
25744,88,4,24,"Lily: Everyone always says, ""Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. ""And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!"
25745,88,4,24,Barney: What song? There was a piece?
25746,88,4,24,Lily: There was a song.
25747,88,4,24,Flashback
25748,88,4,24,Barney: The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?
25749,88,4,24,Ted: I'm with you.
25750,88,4,24,Barney: Now. As I explained...
25751,88,4,24,Ted: What...
25752,88,4,24,Barney takes Ted into his arms while Robin is in her room and heard everything.
25753,88,4,24,Robin: sh1t.
25754,88,4,24,"Marshall, Lily and Robin are at the bar."
25755,88,4,24,Lily: He said that? My God! What an incredible surprise!
25756,88,4,24,Robin: You know since when?
25757,88,4,24,Lily is 8 months.
25758,88,4,24,Robin: And you've said anything since? Bravo.
25759,88,4,24,"Marshall: Bravo, Lily. I mean, what a bomb. Who saw this coming?"
25760,88,4,24,Robin: You know since when?
25761,88,4,24,Marshall: 7 months and 29 days.
25762,88,4,24,Robin: I will do what?
25763,88,4,24,Lily: I know. Are you gonna do?
25764,88,4,24,Robin: I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages.
25765,88,4,24,Marshall: Really?
25766,88,4,24,Robin: No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no.
25767,88,4,24,"Lily: Boy, you're going to break her... The thing that this black mud pump through his veins."
25768,88,4,24,"Robin: You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it."
25769,88,4,24,"Marshall: OK, first... Second, there is a trick you can try. It's risky, but it can pay off. Lack of anything better, I'll call it... The Mosby."
25770,88,4,24,Robin: The Mosby?
25771,88,4,24,"Lily: No, she can not mosbyser."
25772,88,4,24,Marshall: It could squarely mosbyser.
25773,88,4,24,Robin: What is the Mosby?
25774,88,4,24,"Marshall: Do you remember your first time with Ted? You wanted to get on the train Ted, visit his yard."
25775,88,4,24,Robin: I was ready to jump the turnstile.
25776,88,4,24,Marshall: What changed everything?
25777,88,4,24,Ted and Robin dance.
25778,88,4,24,Ted: I think I love you.
25779,88,4,24,Robin: What?
25780,88,4,24,Robin: The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me.
25781,88,4,24,"Marshall: You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts."
25782,88,4,24,End flashback
25783,88,4,24,"Barney: So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise."
25784,88,4,24,Lily: That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.
25785,88,4,24,Barney: Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great. (Tracey returns) So Robin does not like me.
25786,88,4,24,Lily: No.
25787,88,4,24,Barney: Why?
25788,88,4,24,
25789,88,4,24,At the apartment...
25790,88,4,24,Ted: Mr. Goat? (He tries to open the bathroom but the door is closed) M. The goat? Enough. (He manages to enter) Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a...
25791,88,4,24,The goat runs toward him.
25792,88,4,24,On the roof...
25793,88,4,24,"Lily: Marshall, you can pick up Ted?"
25794,88,4,24,"Marshall: I was about to jump. You've not heard saying ""OK"" loop?"
25795,88,4,24,Lily: I'm sorry. Go ahead and jump.
25796,88,4,24,"Marshall: It's good. Sorry, everyone. Lily does not want me jumping. (He descends from the rim) Thank God."
25797,88,4,24,Marshall found Ted lying on the ground and the goat on top of him.
25798,88,4,24,Ted: The hospital!
25799,88,4,24,At the hospital...
25800,88,4,24,Lily: What has happened?
25801,88,4,24,Ted: It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked.
25802,88,4,24,Lily: This is the sweetest and adorable goat in the world.
25803,88,4,24,"Ted: ""The sweetest and adorable goat in the world""?"
25804,88,4,24,"Ted (2030): I lacked sleep, it was certainly not like that, but that's how I remember it."

25810,88,4,24,"Doctor: Yes. But remember, ""Bee"" means ""bee""."
25811,88,4,24,"Ted: Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat."
25812,88,4,24,Lily: Mr. Goat? It's a girl. Her name is Missy.
25813,88,4,24,Marshall: You got beat by a girl.
25814,88,4,24,Ted leaves the room followed by Marshall and Lily.
25815,88,4,24,Barney: So... You're in love with me?
25816,88,4,24,Robin: What? Yes. Much.
25817,88,4,24,Barney: You can stop. Lily told me everything.
25818,88,4,24,"Robin: Damn, Lily!"
25819,88,4,24,Barney: I can not believe it.
25820,88,4,24,"Robin: It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that."
25821,88,4,24,"Barney: Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same."
25822,88,4,24,"Robin: Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, ""stifles it in the bud"" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you."
25823,88,4,24,"Barney: It's going pretty fast, do not you think?"
25824,88,4,24,Robin: What?
25825,88,4,24,Barney: We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?
25826,88,4,24,Robin: Friends.
25827,88,4,24,Barney: My God. You just do it again. You've mosbysé!
25828,88,4,24,Robin: But no.
25829,88,4,24,"Barney: But if, little flirtatious."
25830,88,4,24,Robin: You're right. I've just mosbyser.
25831,88,4,24,Barney: Why are you scared to try?
25832,88,4,24,Robin: Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.
25833,88,4,24,Barney: Bad idea.
25834,88,4,24,Robin: You're right. There must be a mistake.
25835,88,4,24,Barney: No.
25836,88,4,24,Robin: I love you.
25837,88,4,24,Barney: Friends.

25843,88,4,24,They kiss.
25844,88,4,24,Barney: You know what? We'll see later.
25845,88,4,24,"Robin: Yeah, let's go."
25846,88,4,24,They finally come out of the hospital room.
25847,88,4,24,"Ted (2030): It was a long and crazy night, but in the morning, against all odds, I made my presentation."
25848,88,4,24,"Ted: There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not?"
25849,88,4,24,"Man: Ted, listen. You are great and you did a... great job, and you'll make other restaurants very happy one day, but... we...decided to go... in another direction."
25850,88,4,24,Ted: What?
25851,88,4,24,Man 2: Treat yourself with... Rib Town!
25852,88,4,24,Ted: Sven...
25853,88,4,24,At the apartment...
25854,88,4,24,"Marshall: I'll tell you, I will eat more chops."
25855,88,4,24,"Barney: Yeah, right."
25856,88,4,24,Marshall: I will not eat.. never... chops! Before Ted!
25857,88,4,24,Ted: It's a disaster. How I will recover?
25858,88,4,24,"Lily: OK, I'm just asking. You really want to recover?"
25859,88,4,24,Ted: What does that mean?
25860,88,4,24,"Lily: Architecture is killing you and it kills us to see her kill you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want?"
25861,88,4,24,Ted: Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.
25862,88,4,24,"Lily: In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter."
25863,88,4,24,Robin: I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am.
25864,88,4,24,Lily: It continues? Bravo.
25865,88,4,24,"Robin: What someone looks, please."
25866,88,4,24,Lily: Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself.
25867,88,4,24,"Ted: So what, I should do anything?"
25868,88,4,24,Lily: Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap.
25869,88,4,24,"Marshall: You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily."
25870,88,4,24,Lily: A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap!
25871,88,4,24,All: Do not do that. Not cool.
25872,88,4,24,Marshall arrives and jump off the roof on the terrace opposite.
25873,88,4,24,Marshall: I did it!

25880,88,4,24,"Robin jumps in turn, then Barney, followed by Lily and Ted."
25881,88,4,24,"Ted (2030): This is the year that I was left at the altar. The year I was a bartender tared Knocked The year I got fired. The year I got beat by a goat. A girl goat, and more. Yet it was the best year of my life. Because if this had not happened, I never had the best job of my life. But most importantly, I would not have met your mother, because as you know...

26512,90,5,2,"Jen: The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight."
26513,90,5,2,"Ted: No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what"

26627,91,5,3,Lily: Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.
26628,91,5,3,Marshall: Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin
26629,91,5,3,Robin: (slowly) Barrel resin?
26630,91,5,3,Lily: Just go with it.
26631,91,5,3,Robin: So you need a hand throwing it out?
26632,91,5,3,"Marshall: No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family."
26633,91,5,3,"Robin: So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?"
26634,91,5,3,"Marshall: I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?"
26635,91,5,3,"Robin: Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess."
26636,91,5,3,"Marshall: Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle."
26637,91,5,3,"Ted ( 2030): The Bermuda Triangle was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny."

He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that.

26968,92,5,4,"Ted: Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad."
26969,92,5,4,Robin: Show him.
26970,92,5,4,Barney: This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night. (he takes a computer) It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.
26971,92,5,4,**MARSHALL'S VIDEO**
26972,92,5,4,Marshall sings while scrolling pictures of that evening.
26973,92,5,4,"Marshall (voice): It was the best night ever laughter raining down like April showers oh, we talked for hours... best night ever..."
26974,92,5,4,"Ted: oh, that's not good."
26975,92,5,4,"Marshall (always singing in the video): Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day."

26977,92,5,4,"Barney: Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses."

26982,92,5,4,Marshall: Oh.
26983,92,5,4,"Robin: Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water."
26984,92,5,4,"Barney: Let's do it again, soon."

26987,92,5,4,Ted: They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?
26988,92,5,4,"Robin: Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date."
26989,92,5,4,A girl go out from Ted's bathroom.
26990,92,5,4,"Girl: Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you."
26991,92,5,4,She goes out of the apartment.
26992,92,5,4,Ted: Right?
26993,92,5,4,Robin: Who was that?
26994,92,5,4,"Ted: Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens."
26995,92,5,4,"Barney: Uh, no, it doesn't."
26996,92,5,4,"Ted: Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon."
26997,92,5,4,"Barney: Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?"
26998,92,5,4,Ted: Westchester. Why?
26999,92,5,4,Barney: (he laughs) You're the sexless innkeeper.
27000,92,5,4,"Robin: Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!"
27001,92,5,4,"Ted: What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?"
27002,92,5,4,"Barney: Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?"
27003,92,5,4,Ted: Not really.
27004,92,5,4,"Barney: T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. (2008, the whole story of Barney is illustrated with images) The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in..."
27005,92,5,4,"Ted: Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?"
27006,92,5,4,"Barney: Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you"
27007,92,5,4,"Ted: Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?"
27008,92,5,4,"Barney: Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket"
27009,92,5,4,"which basically says you're not interested in, nor probably even capable of, having s*x. And she thought, ""hey, free lodging."""
27010,92,5,4,Ted: No way.
27011,92,5,4,"Barney: I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you."
27012,92,5,4,"Robin: Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!"
27013,92,5,4,Robin and Barney laugh and clap their hands.

27018,92,5,4,Robin: We have. Go on.
27019,92,5,4,Lily: Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!
27020,92,5,4,"Robin: Wait, you guys were serious about that?"
27021,92,5,4,"Marshall: Oh, we never joke about b&b's, especially at the height of syrup season."
27022,92,5,4,"Lily: Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride."
27023,92,5,4,"Marshall: And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there."
27024,92,5,4,"Barney: Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. (he sighs) The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition."
27025,92,5,4,"Lily: Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them."
27026,92,5,4,"Marshall: Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome."
27027,92,5,4,Lily: What's going on?
27028,92,5,4,"Robin: Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys."
27029,92,5,4,"Barney: Plus, the alien thing."
27030,92,5,4,"Lily: Come on,Marshall."
27031,92,5,4,Marshall: Let's go.

27041,92,5,4,"Marshall: No, we're not. We're ugly and gross."
27042,92,5,4,Lily: I thought we did everything right.
27043,92,5,4,Marshall: I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.

27055,92,5,4,"Marshall: If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that."
27056,92,5,4,"Lily: Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing."
27057,92,5,4,"Marshall: One thing? (Lily nods) One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?"

27063,92,5,4,"Ted: Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize."
27064,92,5,4,"Barney: To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?"
27065,92,5,4,"Ted: Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger."

27184,93,5,5,Ted: Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.
27185,93,5,5,Marshall: Drank nothing but Tantrum.
27186,93,5,5,"Ted (2030): Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA."

27200,93,5,5,"Marshall, in bar with Lily: We're doing great."
27201,93,5,5,Ted: Do you watch the Jets game?
27202,93,5,5,Marshall: We most certainly did.
27203,93,5,5,Ted: How'd things go at the doctor?
27204,93,5,5,Marshall: We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.
27205,93,5,5,Barney: Hmm.
27206,93,5,5,Robin: You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges.
27207,93,5,5,Flash-back
27208,93,5,5,Robin is in a bar where she fights.
27209,93,5,5,Robin: Come on!
27210,93,5,5,End of flash-back
27211,93,5,5,"Robin: I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported."
27212,93,5,5,"Ted: Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!"
27213,93,5,5,"Robin: Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen."
27214,93,5,5,Barney: Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.
27215,93,5,5,"Robin: Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am."
27216,93,5,5,"Barney: I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this."
27217,93,5,5,"Robin: Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow."
27218,93,5,5,Barney: A cit...
27219,93,5,5,Robin: I'll think about it.
27220,93,5,5,"Barney: No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on..."
27221,93,5,5,"Robin: Okay, Barney."
27222,93,5,5,Barney: Sorry. It's a rich area.
27223,93,5,5,Robin: It is.
27224,93,5,5,"Barney: But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test."
27225,93,5,5,Robin: How do you know the Canadian test is easy?
27226,93,5,5,Barney: It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?
27227,93,5,5,"Marshall, entering with ""a hat with drink"": Ted! Ted! Check it out! I got black coffee on the left, I got Tantrum on the right! Do you have a phone book?!"
27228,93,5,5,"Ted: Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?"
27229,93,5,5,Marshall tears the phone book.
27230,93,5,5,Marshall: Tantrum!
27231,93,5,5,Ted: Tantrum!
27232,93,5,5,Lily enters in the apartment.
27233,93,5,5,"Lily: All right, let's hit the road."
27234,93,5,5,Ted: You invited Lily?
27235,93,5,5,Marshall: We most certainly did!
27236,93,5,5,Marshall and Lily leave.
27237,93,5,5,"Barney: I don't know if you caught that, but he did the ""we"" thing."
27238,93,5,5,"Ted: Yeah, I heard him."
27239,93,5,5,Barney: Okay.
27240,93,5,5,"Lily, Marshall and Ted are in the car."
27241,93,5,5,Lily: Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.
27242,93,5,5,"Ted: All right, next stop: Chicago."
27243,93,5,5,Lily: I have to pee.
27244,93,5,5,Ted: Couldn't you have gone before we left?
27245,93,5,5,Lily: I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.
27246,93,5,5,She goes out of the car.
27247,93,5,5,"Marshall: Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times."
27248,93,5,5,Ted (2030): It wasn't.
27249,93,5,5,Flash-back
27250,93,5,5,In 1999... Marshall and Ted were singing in the car. *I would walk 500 miles And I would walk 500 more...*
27251,93,5,5,End of flash-back
27252,93,5,5,"Lily: Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee."
27253,93,5,5,Flash-back
27254,93,5,5,"In 1999... In the car, Ted hides the visibility to Marshall."
27255,93,5,5,"Ted: Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper."
27256,93,5,5,End of flash-back
27257,93,5,5,Ted is sleeping in the car.
27258,93,5,5,"Lily, fighting Ted: Ooh, punch buggy yellow!"
27259,93,5,5,Ted: Ow!
27260,93,5,5,"Lily: Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee."
27261,93,5,5,Flash-back
27262,93,5,5,In 1999...
27263,93,5,5,Ted: Thank you!
27264,93,5,5,End of flash-back
27265,93,5,5,"Lily: Great. Oh, hey, Ted..."
27266,93,5,5,Ted: You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.
27267,93,5,5,"Lily: No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something."
27268,93,5,5,"Ted: Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys."
27269,93,5,5,"Marshall: Goodbye, Sparky."
27270,93,5,5,Lily: It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.
27271,93,5,5,"Voice: Goodbye Sparky, by Nick Leotti. Read to you by Kenny Rogers."
27272,93,5,5,Marshall: Oh!
27273,93,5,5,"Kenny: Chapter one: When I first saw Sparky, he reminded me of my favorite comb; he was missing a lot of teeth, but I loved him anyway. Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business."
27274,93,5,5,"Lily: That reminds me, I have to pee."
27275,93,5,5,In the apartment...
27276,93,5,5,"Barney: ""How many stars are on the flag?"""
27277,93,5,5,"Robin: 50, one for each state."
27278,93,5,5,"Barney: ""What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?"""
27279,93,5,5,"Robin: The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready."
27280,93,5,5,"Barney: Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: ""Who is this?"""
27281,93,5,5,Robin: Queen Elizabeth II.
27282,93,5,5,"Barney: No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: ""What the hell is this?"""
27283,93,5,5,"Robin: Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played..."
27284,93,5,5,"Barney: Wrong. The answer we were looking for was ""I don't care, it's dumb"". Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin."
27285,93,5,5,In the car...
27286,93,5,5,"Kenny:...because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit- which isn't actually a ball, but's round like a ball- a football- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball- Indian rubber ball..."
27287,93,5,5,Voice: This ends disk seven. The audio book continues on disk eight. (Ted removes the disk and puts back the other one) Disk eight.
27288,93,5,5,"Kenny: Lacrosse ball, volleyball..."
27289,93,5,5,"Ted: Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!"
27290,93,5,5,"Lily: Ah, I do."
27291,93,5,5,"Ted (2030): It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse."
27292,93,5,5,"Marshall: Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there."
27293,93,5,5,Ted: Hotel?
27294,93,5,5,"Ted, Marshall and Lily arrive in the hotel."
27295,93,5,5,"Woman: Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed and Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since."
27296,93,5,5,"Marshall: Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?"
27297,93,5,5,"Woman: Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?"
27298,93,5,5,In the apartment...
27299,93,5,5,"Ted (2030): And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American."
27300,93,5,5,Robin: I want to say- Jefferson?
27301,93,5,5,Barney: Correct.
27302,93,5,5,Robin: Oh!
27303,93,5,5,Barney: Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.
27304,93,5,5,"Robin: Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!"
27305,93,5,5,"Barney: All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?"
27306,93,5,5,"Robin: That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the ""Hey, Vern"" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy."
27307,93,5,5,"Barney: Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?"
27308,93,5,5,"Robin: Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face."
27309,93,5,5,"Barney: Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American."
27310,93,5,5,
27311,93,5,5,In the hotel...
27312,93,5,5,Woman: Look who's back from the wishing well.
27313,93,5,5,"Ted: It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road."
27314,93,5,5,"Marshall: Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night."
27315,93,5,5,"Lily: Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?"
27316,93,5,5,"Woman: All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?"
27317,93,5,5,Ted (2030): And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.
27318,93,5,5,Marshall and Lily: We'd love cornmeal body scrub!
27319,93,5,5,Ted: Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.
27320,93,5,5,Robin walks on the street.
27321,93,5,5,"Robin: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. (She throws one bottle on the floor) Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. (She crosses the road and enter into the bar) *O Canada Our home and native land...* Oh, God, I miss it. *True patriots love...*"
27322,93,5,5,Ted knocks at Marshall and Lily's bedroom door.
27323,93,5,5,"Ted: Hey, man."
27324,93,5,5,Marshall: Shh.
27325,93,5,5,Ted: Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?
27326,93,5,5,Marshall: Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.
27327,93,5,5,Marshall gets out of his room in bathrobe. Ted and Marshall are in the car.
27328,93,5,5,"Marshall: Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?"
27329,93,5,5,Ted: Chicago.
27330,93,5,5,"Marshall: What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!"
27331,93,5,5,Ted: She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.
27332,93,5,5,Marshall: I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?
27333,93,5,5,4 minutes later...
27334,93,5,5,"Marshall and Ted, singing: *And I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more...*"
27335,93,5,5,"Ted: Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?"
27336,93,5,5,"Marshall: If she's pissed, she's pissed."
27337,93,5,5,Ted: Pfft.
27338,93,5,5,"Ted (2030): When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight."
27339,93,5,5,Barney enters in a room where Robin is.
27340,93,5,5,Barney: Good morning.
27341,93,5,5,"Robin: Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?"
27342,93,5,5,Barney: You went Canadian.
27343,93,5,5,Robin: How Canadian?
27344,93,5,5,Barney: This Canadian. (He opens the curtains) Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.
27345,93,5,5,"Robin: Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team."
27346,93,5,5,Flash-back
27347,93,5,5,"Robin: We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto."
27348,93,5,5,End of flash-back
27349,93,5,5,"Robin: How did you find me, anyway?"
27350,93,5,5,"Barney: You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic..."
27351,93,5,5,Robin: Canada isn't across the Atlantic.
27352,93,5,5,"Barney: You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours."
27353,93,5,5,"Robin: Barney, I'm not taking the test."
27354,93,5,5,"Barney: God, you're still drunk."
27355,93,5,5,"Robin: Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be."
27356,93,5,5,"Barney: Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee."
27357,93,5,5,Ted and Marshall are in Chicago and they're eating.
27358,93,5,5,Ted: Kind of cross.
27359,93,5,5,Marshall: You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.
27360,93,5,5,Ted: Just like old times!
27361,93,5,5,Marshall: I feel so young again except for the chest pains.
27362,93,5,5,Ted: But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?
27363,93,5,5,Man: It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.
27364,93,5,5,Marshall: Cornmeal...
27365,93,5,5,Lily: We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!
27366,93,5,5,Ted: I can't believe you guys are closing.
27367,93,5,5,Man: I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.
27368,93,5,5,Barney: It's like an entire country without a tailor.
27369,93,5,5,"Robin: Yeah, give me two coffees."
27370,93,5,5,"Women: $3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?"
27371,93,5,5,Robin: What game?
27372,93,5,5,Women: The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.
27373,93,5,5,"Robin: Oh, I guess I missed it."
27374,93,5,5,"Women: Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change."
27375,93,5,5,Robin: I'm not American.
27376,93,5,5,"Women: American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No ""please"" or ""thank you"" for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian."
27377,93,5,5,Barney: What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.
27378,93,5,5,"Robin: Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either."
27379,93,5,5,Barney: And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.
27380,93,5,5,In Chicago...
27381,93,5,5,Marshall: I don't want this anymore.
27382,93,5,5,"Ted: Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake."
27383,93,5,5,Marshall: We shouldn't have left Lily.
27384,93,5,5,"Ted: Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?"
27385,93,5,5,"Marshall: I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!"""
27386,93,5,5,"Ted: What exactly is ""Ted's fault""?"
27387,93,5,5,"Marshall: This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!"
27388,93,5,5,"Ted: We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily."
27389,93,5,5,Marshall: That is not true.
27390,93,5,5,"Ted: It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away."
27391,93,5,5,"Marshall: Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please."
27392,93,5,5,Ted throws the keys to him and Marshall bends.
27393,93,5,5,"Barney: Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back."
27394,93,5,5,"Robin: When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country."
27395,93,5,5,"Barney: Okay, that's it. (He climbs on a chair) Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one: get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a ""jhoke"". Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. (He sits down and three men arrive behind him) Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a ""tie""."
27396,93,5,5,A child locks the door with a hockey stick.
27397,93,5,5,Ted and Marshall are in the car.
27398,93,5,5,"Kenny: Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows."
27399,93,5,5,"Marshall: I'm sorry, ted!"
27400,93,5,5,"Ted: I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!"
27401,93,5,5,"Marshall: No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?"
27402,93,5,5,"Ted: Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?"
27403,93,5,5,"Marshall: Hells, yeah!"
27404,93,5,5,Ted: Or listen to the Sparky book again?
27405,93,5,5,Marshall: Listen to the Sparky book again.
27406,93,5,5,Ted: Okay. Let's listen to it again.
27407,93,5,5,Barney and Robin return to the apartment.
27408,93,5,5,"Barney: Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday."
27409,93,5,5,"Robin: Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, ""Yeah, America's cool."""
27410,93,5,5,Barney: Hmm.
27411,93,5,5,"Robin: And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, ""Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too."" I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian."
27412,93,5,5,"Barney: Wait, you can do that?"
27413,93,5,5,"Robin: Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two."
27414,93,5,5,Barney: I see.
27415,93,5,5,Robin: You understand?
27416,93,5,5,"Barney: No, I can see out of my left eye again."
27417,93,5,5,Ted and Marshall return in Marshall and Lily's room.
27418,93,5,5,"Marshall: Hey, baby? Baby?"
27419,93,5,5,Lily: Hmm? Yeah?
27420,93,5,5,Marshall: I'm so sorry that we left you.
27421,93,5,5,"Lily: Did you go somewhere, sweetie?"
27422,93,5,5,Flash-back
27423,93,5,5,"Ted (2030): Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone."
27424,93,5,5,Lily's phone vibrates.
27425,93,5,5,"Lily: Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah..."
27426,93,5,5,End of flash-back
27427,93,5,5,"Lily: So, I had a great time, too."
27428,93,5,5,Marshall: That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.
27429,93,5,5,"Lily: Oh, that's okay."
27430,93,5,5,"Ted (2030): And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it 19 minutes later."
27431,93,5,5,"Marshall: God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!"
27432,93,5,5,Ted: It's like a hot ball of lead!
27433,93,5,5,"Marshall: Baby, cut it out of me."
27434,93,5,5,"Ted and Marshall are in the car, again."
27435,93,5,5,"Marshall: That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?"
27436,93,5,5,Ted: I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?
27437,93,5,5,"Marshall: You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?"
27438,93,5,5,"Lily, on the roof of the car: Tantrum! I have to pee."
27439,94,5,6,"Ted (2030): In autumn 2009, a new couple moved just above.We had not met but you could hear all the time. They kept... children, say they did not stop ""playing the bagpipes."""
27440,94,5,6,Robin: This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.
27441,94,5,6,Ted: I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.
27442,94,5,6,"Robin: It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park."
27443,94,5,6,Ted: Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!
27444,94,5,6,GENERIC
27445,94,5,6,"Ted is at McLaren's, alone."
27446,94,5,6,Ted (2030): I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.
27447,94,5,6,Barney joins him.
27448,94,5,6,Barney: I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.
27449,94,5,6,Ted: Not at all.
27450,94,5,6,Barney: Look what I saw yesterday.
27451,94,5,6,Flashback
27452,94,5,6,"Barney, Marshall and Lily are in the kitchen of the latter."
27453,94,5,6,"Lily: Baby, you can wash it?"
27454,94,5,6,Marshall: No problem.
27455,94,5,6,Barney: I gotta go.
27456,94,5,6,End flashback
27457,94,5,6,"Barney: She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum."
27458,94,5,6,Ted: There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.
27459,94,5,6,Barney: They have a big problem.
27460,94,5,6,"Ted: I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever."
27461,94,5,6,"Barney: If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half."
27462,94,5,6,Ted: And a half?
27463,94,5,6,Barney: An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.
27464,94,5,6,Marshall arrived in turn.
27465,94,5,6,Marshall: What's new?
27466,94,5,6,Barney: Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.
27467,94,5,6,"Ted: According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart."
27468,94,5,6,"Marshall: Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?"
27469,94,5,6,Barney: I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.
27470,94,5,6,"Marshall: Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue."
27471,94,5,6,Barney: Let me ask you a question.
27472,94,5,6,Marshall: Go ahead.
27473,94,5,6,"Barney: Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?"
27474,94,5,6,Marshall: Not really.
27475,94,5,6,"Barney: So what is the problem of Lily, not yours."
27476,94,5,6,"Marshall: But if I said that, we will play, so..."
27477,94,5,6,"Barney: You argue. Robin, we do not fight."
27478,94,5,6,Ted: Of course I do.
27479,94,5,6,"Barney: No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue..."
27480,94,5,6,Flashback
27481,94,5,6,Barney takes his breakfast when Robin arrives in a dressing gown.
27482,94,5,6,"Robin: Why is there a bag of pants marked ""April 2008"" in your closet?"
27483,94,5,6,"Barney gets up and leaves his apartment, leaving Robin unanswered."
27484,94,5,6,End flashback
27485,94,5,6,Ted: So when you think you will play and you get up you go?
27486,94,5,6,Barney: It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.
27487,94,5,6,Ted: This is not true.
27488,94,5,6,Marshall: I can not believe Robin supports it.
27489,94,5,6,Barney: Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.
27490,94,5,6,Flashback
27491,94,5,6,Robin and Barney are at the apartment of the latter.
27492,94,5,6,Robin: The ties go to the machine?
27493,94,5,6,"Barney Probably not. Why? You want what? My God, you want what?"
27494,94,5,6,She does not respond and unbuttons her blouse.
27495,94,5,6,End flashback
27496,94,5,6,Marshall: You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.
27497,94,5,6,"Ted: Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird."
27498,94,5,6,Marshall: Call me crazy.
27499,94,5,6,Ted: Mad.
27500,94,5,6,"Marshall: But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed."
27501,94,5,6,"Barney: There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily."
27502,94,5,6,Flash
27503,94,5,6,Barney imagine the scenario. He returned to the apartment where Lily is already.
27504,94,5,6,"Lily: Barney, you came home!"
27505,94,5,6,She jumps into the arms of Barney and they kiss.
27506,94,5,6,End flash
27507,94,5,6,Marshall: Go to the basics!
27508,94,5,6,Barney: Okay.
27509,94,5,6,Flash
27510,94,5,6,"Barney: Thank you, doll."
27511,94,5,6,"Lily: Honey, you're going to wash it?"
27512,94,5,6,"Barney: I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?"
27513,94,5,6,Lily: No. Of course not.
27514,94,5,6,"Barney: Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing."
27515,94,5,6,Lily: Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.
27516,94,5,6,Barney: It's because you're a woman.
27517,94,5,6,Lily: I do not even know why we laugh!
27518,94,5,6,Barney: Of course not.
27519,94,5,6,End flash
27520,94,5,6,Ted: Are you kidding me.
27521,94,5,6,"Marshall: Wait, Ted. Listen to the man."
27522,94,5,6,"Barney: Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery."
27523,94,5,6,Flash
27524,94,5,6,Lily and Barney are sitting on the couch.
27525,94,5,6,"Barney: Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes."
27526,94,5,6,Lily: You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.
27527,94,5,6,She lowers the light and dance in a way... sexy.
27528,94,5,6,"Barney: Now, turn around."
27529,94,5,6,End flash
27530,94,5,6,Ted: You beat him or I do it?
27531,94,5,6,Marshall: He's right.
27532,94,5,6,"Ted: No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003."
27533,94,5,6,Barney: The piercing was cool.
27534,94,5,6,"Marshall: It was cool, huh?"
27535,94,5,6,Ted: Stay with me! Barney is wrong.
27536,94,5,6,"Marshall: No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away."
27537,94,5,6,Ted: You just said the opposite!
27538,94,5,6,Marshall: I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!
27539,94,5,6,Barney: You're welcome.
27540,94,5,6,Robin joins them.
27541,94,5,6,Ted: Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.
27542,94,5,6,Robin: I think that's true.
27543,94,5,6,Barney: I told you.
27544,94,5,6,Ted: Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.
27545,94,5,6,"Robin: You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy."
27546,94,5,6,"Ted: Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them."
27547,94,5,6,Robin: Thank you.
27548,94,5,6,"Barney: Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!"
27549,94,5,6,"Barney hand, followed by Robin."
27550,94,5,6,Ted: Have fun.
27551,94,5,6,"Marshall: Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work."
27552,94,5,6,Ted: I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.
27553,94,5,6,Marshall: Will it work.
27554,94,5,6,Ted: A second time. This is a bad idea.
27555,94,5,6,"Marshall: Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion."
27556,94,5,6,Ted: No. She will be angry and you will play.
27557,94,5,6,Marshall: It is a slap bet?
27558,94,5,6,Ted: We bet a slap.
27559,94,5,6,Marshall is in the kitchen with Lily.
27560,94,5,6,"Lily: Baby, you can do the dishes?"
27561,94,5,6,"Marshall: Lily, I am delighted that you mention."
27562,94,5,6,Ted opens the door to his apartment to let in Marshall with his business.
27563,94,5,6,Marshall: I can stay here tonight?
27564,94,5,6,Ted slaps him.
27565,94,5,6,"Ted: I am preparing the couch, man."
27566,94,5,6,Barney and Robin join Ted and Marshall at the bar.
27567,94,5,6,Robin: The ski babes are back!
27568,94,5,6,Barney and Robin kissing.
27569,94,5,6,Ted: How was the trip?
27570,94,5,6,Barney: Okay.
27571,94,5,6,"Robin: We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags."
27572,94,5,6,Robin is about to leave when sending him a kiss Barney makes it to emblant to catch.
27573,94,5,6,Ted: What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?
27574,94,5,6,"Barney: It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?"
27575,94,5,6,Ted: We all came out a year.
27576,94,5,6,"Barney: short, and your weekend?"
27577,94,5,6,Marshall: Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!
27578,94,5,6,Flashback
27579,94,5,6,Marshall removing the dishes in the sink.
27580,94,5,6,"Lily: Baby, you can do the dishes?"
27581,94,5,6,"Marshall: Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, ""Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies. "" You see? It's just..."
27582,94,5,6,End flashback
27583,94,5,6,"Marshall: I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?"
27584,94,5,6,"Barney: What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""?"
27585,94,5,6,Marshall: I should have noted.
27586,94,5,6,Flashback
27587,94,5,6,Marshall: I'm making more money than you.
27588,94,5,6,Lily: Excuse me?
27589,94,5,6,Marshall: Dance for me.
27590,94,5,6,End flashback
27591,94,5,6,"Marshall: It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply."
27592,94,5,6,Flashback
27593,94,5,6,Marshall: It started with the dishes but after...
27594,94,5,6,Lily: So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.
27595,94,5,6,"Marshall: It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest."
27596,94,5,6,Lily: I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.
27597,94,5,6,Marshall: You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.
27598,94,5,6,"Lily: If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit."
27599,94,5,6,Marshall: My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.
27600,94,5,6,"Lily: Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance."
27601,94,5,6,"Marshall: Do not do that, please."
27602,94,5,6,End flashback
27603,94,5,6,"Marshall: Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize."
27604,94,5,6,"Barney: You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits."
27605,94,5,6,Marshall: He's right.
27606,94,5,6,Ted: Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.
27607,94,5,6,Marshall: This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...
27608,94,5,6,Barney: What do you eat?
27609,94,5,6,"Marshall: Well sh1t, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!"
27610,94,5,6,By Marshall and Robin arrives.
27611,94,5,6,"Robin: Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer."
27612,94,5,6,"Barney: Hey, Ro-Ro."
27613,94,5,6,They kiss.
27614,94,5,6,Ted: You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?
27615,94,5,6,Robin: Nothing. We're just happy.
27616,94,5,6,"Barney: As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby."""
27617,94,5,6,Ted: I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.
27618,94,5,6,Robin: So you talked to the neighbors?
27619,94,5,6,"Ted: Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back."

27623,94,5,6,Robin: Some old?
27624,94,5,6,Ted: Really old.
27625,94,5,6,Robin: So you did what?
27626,94,5,6,"Ted: I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some racist comments and I left."
27627,94,5,6,"Ted (2030): The days of Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever. (At the bar, Barney and Robin dance) and Marshall and Lily have continued to argue."
27628,94,5,6,
27629,94,5,6,At the apartment Marshall and Lily...
27630,94,5,6,"Marshall: I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it."
27631,94,5,6,"Lily: Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself."
27632,94,5,6,Marshall: I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.
27633,94,5,6,Lily: You will perhaps have to do it again.
27634,94,5,6,Ted is on his couch.
27635,94,5,6,Ted (2030): And I heard more than a bagpipe parade of St. Patrick.
27636,94,5,6,Between Marshall.
27637,94,5,6,"Marshall: I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon."
27638,94,5,6,Ted: It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.
27639,94,5,6,"Marshall: Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned."
27640,94,5,6,"Ted: You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames."

27645,94,5,6,At Ted's apartment...
27646,94,5,6,"Ted: You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?"
27647,94,5,6,"Robin: Seriously, stop."
27648,94,5,6,Ted is on the phone.
27649,94,5,6,Ted: It's T-Mose.
27650,94,5,6,Robin: I do not like with you either.
27651,94,5,6,End flashback
27652,94,5,6,"Marshall: Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose."
27653,94,5,6,Ted: T-Mose was great. I think of the show.
27654,94,5,6,Marshall: The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.
27655,94,5,6,Ted: They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.
27656,94,5,6,"Ted (2030): And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin."
27657,94,5,6,"Barney, Robin and Ted are at McLaren's."
27658,94,5,6,Barney: How will Marshall and Lily?
27659,94,5,6,"Robin: Those two worry me, really."
27660,94,5,6,"Barney: You and your big, huge heart."
27661,94,5,6,Ted: Enough. The game is over.
27662,94,5,6,Barney: What do you mean by that?
27663,94,5,6,"Robin: Who, him?"
27664,94,5,6,A man is sitting at their table.
27665,94,5,6,"Ted: It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too ""surnomants"". It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time."
27666,94,5,6,Robin: How would you know that?
27667,94,5,6,Ted: Phil told me.
27668,94,5,6,Barney: Who the hell is Phil?
27669,94,5,6,Ted: Your downstairs neighbor.
27670,94,5,6,Man: I'm Phil. 12-B.
27671,94,5,6,Ted: And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?
27672,94,5,6,Barney: All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.
27673,94,5,6,Flashback
27674,94,5,6,Barney and Robin are in a chairlift.
27675,94,5,6,Barney: I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.
27676,94,5,6,Robin: It's your board that is zero.
27677,94,5,6,Barney: You're on the side of Lily? You... (The chairlift stops) No. We will argue and I can not spin.
27678,94,5,6,Robin: I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.
27679,94,5,6,Barney: Or so I tried the jump?
27680,94,5,6,Robin: Or just the pants?
27681,94,5,6,Barney: This trick of dodging is over?
27682,94,5,6,Robin: I think.
27683,94,5,6,Barney: You have the? This is the smallest!
27684,94,5,6,Robin: They fight because of you!?
27685,94,5,6,End flashback
27686,94,5,6,Barney: And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.
27687,94,5,6,Robin: All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.
27688,94,5,6,Barney: The tie murdered by Robin.
27689,94,5,6,Robin: The hidden camera in the headboard.
27690,94,5,6,"Barney: As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match."
27691,94,5,6,Robin: Barney for the millionth time...
27692,94,5,6,They argue.
27693,94,5,6,Ted: I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!
27694,94,5,6,"Barney: Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations."
27695,94,5,6,Robin: It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.
27696,94,5,6,Ted: I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.
27697,94,5,6,Robin: Stop it.
27698,94,5,6,At the apartment Marshall and Lily... Marshall is sitting on the couch.
27699,94,5,6,"Lily: Marshall, dinner is ready."
27700,94,5,6,Marshall: You've done for me?
27701,94,5,6,"Lily: No, but what is your favorite."
27702,94,5,6,It sounds and Marshall will open.
27703,94,5,6,Barney: We need advice.
27704,94,5,6,"Ted (2030): Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland."
27705,94,5,6,Flashback
27706,94,5,6,We see scenes of arguments between Barney and Robin.
27707,94,5,6,End flashback
27708,94,5,6,"Ted (2030): And in the end, Lily and Marshall had the same reaction."
27709,94,5,6,Marshall: I'll do the dishes directly to my death.
27710,94,5,6,"Lily: I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak."
27711,94,5,6,"Marshall: Sure, honey."
27712,94,5,6,Lily: I love you.
27713,94,5,6,Marshall: I love you too.
27714,94,5,6,"Robin: You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?"
27715,94,5,6,Marshall: I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.
27716,94,5,6,Lily: And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.
27717,94,5,6,Barney and Robin laugh.
27718,94,5,6,Barney: More important than winning.
27719,94,5,6,"Robin: Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?"
27720,94,5,6,"Lily: The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part."
27721,94,5,6,Robin: Good night.
27722,94,5,6,Barney and Robin go.
27723,94,5,6,Barney: What about now?
27724,94,5,6,Robin: I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.
27725,94,5,6,"Barney: Or, there is a bench in the elevator."
27726,94,5,6,"Robin: That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?"
27727,94,5,6,Barney: Grave. It's not a competition.
27728,94,5,6,At the apartment Marshall and Lily...
27729,94,5,6,Lily: We won!
27730,94,5,6,Marshall: Best couple of the world!
27731,94,5,6,He opens a bottle of champagne. On the couch...
27732,94,5,6,Marshall: Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.
27733,94,5,6,Lily: You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.
27734,94,5,6,They kiss.
27735,94,5,6,"Ted (2030): And once the first fight set, all the others, well, they are also regulated."
27736,94,5,6,"Neighbors of Ted, the luster of living aspen and a bagpipe sounds."
27737,95,5,7,"Ted (2030): Children, since I know your Uncle Barney, he has always had strong views on relationships."
27738,95,5,7,Flashback
27739,95,5,7,In 2008... The band is at McLaren's.
27740,95,5,7,"Barney: Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted."
27741,95,5,7,End flashback
27742,95,5,7,"Ted (2030): And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend."
27743,95,5,7,"Marshall, Lily, Barney, Ted and Robin are at the apartment of the latter."
27744,95,5,7,Barney: Come on. Open it. It's p0rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.
27745,95,5,7,Ted: It's your p0rn collection.
27746,95,5,7,"Barney: This is my collection of p0rn! I offer you my p0rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more."
27747,95,5,7,"Lily: Voluntarily, you abandon your p0rn...? You're really serious."
27748,95,5,7,Marshall: This is obvious.
27749,95,5,7,Barney: What does that mean?
27750,95,5,7,"Marshall: Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles."
27751,95,5,7,Barney: What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.
27752,95,5,7,"Marshall: It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there."
27753,95,5,7,Lily: He really is growing at a time.
27754,95,5,7,"Barney: We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you."
27755,95,5,7,Robin: He speaks to p0rn.
27756,95,5,7,"Ted: Hi, Robin. A more."
27757,95,5,7,Robin: Hi.
27758,95,5,7,Barney and Robin go.
27759,95,5,7,"Lily: My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty?"
27760,95,5,7,"Marshall: You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises."
27761,95,5,7,Lily: You can get rid of it.
27762,95,5,7,"Ted: No, it's not a problem. I'll do it."
27763,95,5,7,Lily: Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash.
27764,95,5,7,Marshall: I read six of the words you just said about this jacket.
27765,95,5,7,"Ted: Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it."
27766,95,5,7,Lily: Because...
27767,95,5,7,"Ted: Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Barney who abandons his p0rn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Barney Stinson as we know it."
27768,95,5,7,Marshall: So what? They are happy.
27769,95,5,7,Lily: Let's go. A more.
27770,95,5,7,"Lily and Marshall go in turn, leaving Ted alone. In the hallway..."
27771,95,5,7,Marshall: So you're what?
27772,95,5,7,Lily: I Tail-Dalle.
27773,95,5,7,Marshall: What...? I thought I had seen in one take.
27774,95,5,7,Lily: Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle.
27775,95,5,7,Ted is alone in the apartment and sort p0rn.
27776,95,5,7,"Ted: ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write ""Buckminster Fuller."""
27777,95,5,7,"Ted (2030): Children, pornography is wrong, and when I got rid of that horrible pornography on the field..."
27778,95,5,7,Ted: I get rid of this horrible pornography on the field.
27779,95,5,7,Ted (2030): There is something terrible happened.
27780,95,5,7,He stumbles into the chair and all the tapes fall. Full of tapes with a fly that lands in the VCR.
27781,95,5,7,Voice: ArchiSexture.
27782,95,5,7,"Barney: If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p0rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!"
27783,95,5,7,GENERIC
27784,95,5,7,"Barney: I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy. (Marshall and Lily have joined Ted) Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p0rn... (Barney turns the camera towards the bed where a woman waits) Do not worry. The green light means it is off."
27785,95,5,7,Ted cut the video.
27786,95,5,7,Lily: We're sure he had done?
27787,95,5,7,"Ted: There is no reason to take it seriously, though?"
27788,95,5,7,"Lily: No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin."
27789,95,5,7,Ted (2030): But over time I began to notice things. Barney and Robin have stopped their crazy adventures.
27790,95,5,7,In McLaren's...
27791,95,5,7,Lily: So what you did last night?
27792,95,5,7,"Robin: I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable."
27793,95,5,7,Barney: It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.
27794,95,5,7,Ted (2030): Barney stopped being himself.
27795,95,5,7,"Ted: I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane."
27796,95,5,7,"Barney: Sorry, I have my own way tonight."
27797,95,5,7,Barney became obese.
27798,95,5,7,Ted (2030): And Robin was annoyed when he opened his mouth.
27799,95,5,7,Lily: How do you go?
27800,95,5,7,Barney: Super. Relations are deadly...
27801,95,5,7,Robin: Shut up...
27802,95,5,7,Barney: Exchanges and compromise...
27803,95,5,7,Robin: Shut up...
27804,95,5,7,Barney: Monogamy is the best.
27805,95,5,7,Robin: Shut up.
27806,95,5,7,Barney: Tagline!
27807,95,5,7,Robin: Shut up.
27808,95,5,7,Ted (2030): But it got worse... more
27809,95,5,7,Barney: More hungry...
27810,95,5,7,Barney looks for a kiss but Robin does not respond.
27811,95,5,7,"Ted (2030): The more they said everything was fine. In truth, Barney and Robin had just let go. But after a few weeks for us, they looked like that."
27812,95,5,7,"Robin and Ted meet Barney, Marshall and Lily at the bar but they are obese."
27813,95,5,7,Barney: I can... in a minute.
27814,95,5,7,At Ted's apartment...
27815,95,5,7,Ted: They kill.
27816,95,5,7,Lily: They love each other.
27817,95,5,7,"Ted: Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old."
27818,95,5,7,Marshall: My favorite cop show.
27819,95,5,7,Ted: This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.
27820,95,5,7,Lily: They are perfect together.
27821,95,5,7,Ted: It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.
27822,95,5,7,Marshall: We are two dominant sets.
27823,95,5,7,"Lily: Of course, my heart."
27824,95,5,7,"Marshall: If they are not happy, why not break?"
27825,95,5,7,Ted: They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.
27826,95,5,7,Marshall: I think the first who plays Barney deflates.
27827,95,5,7,"Lily: It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say ""selfish"" nicely?"
27828,95,5,7,Marshall Independent.
27829,95,5,7,Lily: Independents. Every relationship goes through there.
27830,95,5,7,"Marshall: It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle..."
27831,95,5,7,Ted: Talk about Space Orgy?
27832,95,5,7,Marshall: Yeah.
27833,95,5,7,Lily: It's a bad time. Let us do things.
27834,95,5,7,Marshall: She's right.
27835,95,5,7,"Lily: Two against one, Ted. Let them."
27836,95,5,7,Ted (2030): I left them alone. But this weekend there...
27837,95,5,7,Marshall and Barney are the McLaren's and Barney is still eating.
27838,95,5,7,"Barney: Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?"
27839,95,5,7,"Marshall: I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?"
27840,95,5,7,Barney: Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!
27841,95,5,7,Marshall: So you're happy?
27842,95,5,7,"Barney: Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, ""Every moment is a battle."""
27843,95,5,7,Marshall: So you're happy?
27844,95,5,7,Barney: And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.
27845,95,5,7,Flashback
27846,95,5,7,Barney and Robin are in bed.
27847,95,5,7,"Barney: Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan."
27848,95,5,7,Robin: Okay. Decides that the piece.
27849,95,5,7,He throws the room.
27850,95,5,7,Barney: What was the pizza again?
27851,95,5,7,Robin: Face.
27852,95,5,7,Barney: It's face.
27853,95,5,7,End flashback
27854,95,5,7,"Barney: s*x... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?"
27855,95,5,7,Marshall enters Ted's apartment.
27856,95,5,7,Marshall: We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.
27857,95,5,7,Ted: What next?
27858,95,5,7,Marshall: We will release... the Kraken.
27859,95,5,7,Flashback
27860,95,5,7,"Ted (2030): Children, as you know, earlier this year I learned that Lily had broken no one, not two, but seven of my past relationships."
27861,95,5,7,End flashback
27862,95,5,7,"Ted, Marshall and Lily are at the bar."
27863,95,5,7,Lily: Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.
27864,95,5,7,Marshall: But you're the best.
27865,95,5,7,"Lily: I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker."
27866,95,5,7,Ted: Find me someone.
27867,95,5,7,Lily: I just started.
27868,95,5,7,Marshall: Please. You've got to break. This relationship is killing them.
27869,95,5,7,"Lily: I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things."
27870,95,5,7,Ted: It's two against one.
27871,95,5,7,Lily: But the one that's me.
27872,95,5,7,She gets up and goes to the counter Barney sitting at a table... to eat.
27873,95,5,7,Ted: No need for it. We can do it alone.
27874,95,5,7,Marshall: How?
27875,95,5,7,"Ted: When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball?"
27876,95,5,7,Flashback
27877,95,5,7,Robin and Ted are in the restaurant.
27878,95,5,7,Robin: You do not have the right to do this to me.
27879,95,5,7,Ted: What are you talking?
27880,95,5,7,Robin: From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?
27881,95,5,7,End flashback
27882,95,5,7,"Ted: If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break."
27883,95,5,7,"Marshall: That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl? (Barney wipes his hands on his shirt) Okay, going to the ring."
27884,95,5,7,Barney and Robin are in the restaurant. Ted and Marshall are also and monitor them.
27885,95,5,7,Marshall: A surveillance van.
27886,95,5,7,Ted: What?
27887,95,5,7,"Marshall: It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, ""That's not why I signed,"" or stuff like that."
27888,95,5,7,Ted: The server arrives.
27889,95,5,7,"Robin: Please, shut up."
27890,95,5,7,Barney: What?
27891,95,5,7,"Robin: I thought you had mentioned, sorry. (The waiter brings them two glasses of champagne) This is an engagement ring?Are you...?"
27892,95,5,7,"Barney: No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?"
27893,95,5,7,Robin: We're committed to one another.
27894,95,5,7,Barney: Your business is already in my apartment.
27895,95,5,7,Robin: Easier for taxes.
27896,95,5,7,Barney: And for your naturalization.
27897,95,5,7,"Robin: ""Scherbatsky"" is hard to spell."
27898,95,5,7,Barney: My mother would be so happy.
27899,95,5,7,"Robin: Yeah, I guess."
27900,95,5,7,Barney: No reason not to do so.
27901,95,5,7,
27902,95,5,7,The band is back at the bar.
27903,95,5,7,Barney: We get married!
27904,95,5,7,"Robin: Not so loud, sh1t."
27905,95,5,7,Lily: What did you do? I'm furious now. It will not?
27906,95,5,7,Robin: You will be my bridesmaid?
27907,95,5,7,"Lily: Oh, my God! I'd love to!"
27908,95,5,7,Lily throws herself into the arms of Robin.
27909,95,5,7,At Ted's apartment...
27910,95,5,7,"Lily: You have lost your mind? You knew they were playing that first deflates, and what? You give them an engagement ring!Okay, that's good. I care. I return to the center stage for a final rupture."
27911,95,5,7,Marshall: What next?
27912,95,5,7,"Lily: They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends."
27913,95,5,7,Flashback
27914,95,5,7,The band is at the bar.
27915,95,5,7,Robin: You do not know any that girl over there?
27916,95,5,7,"Barney: No, I do not think. (The woman bends down to pick something she brought down) No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?"
27917,95,5,7,Robin: Really?
27918,95,5,7,They argue.
27919,95,5,7,End flashback
27920,95,5,7,"Lily: Number three, the altercation Star Wars."
27921,95,5,7,Flashback
27922,95,5,7,Robin is Barney.
27923,95,5,7,Robin: You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?
27924,95,5,7,Barney: It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper.
27925,95,5,7,Robin: He wears a diaper.
27926,95,5,7,"Barney: No, it's protective armor."
27927,95,5,7,Robin: A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.
27928,95,5,7,Barney: Come on.
27929,95,5,7,Robin: It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.
27930,95,5,7,"Barney: You know, I'm sick."
27931,95,5,7,Robin: I said nothing.
27932,95,5,7,"Barney: The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper..."
27933,95,5,7,End flashback
27934,95,5,7,"Lily: And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American War."
27935,95,5,7,Flashback
27936,95,5,7,In McLaren's...
27937,95,5,7,"Barney: thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?"
27938,95,5,7,Robin: You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.
27939,95,5,7,"Barney: She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?"
27940,95,5,7,Robin: Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.
27941,95,5,7,Barney: I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord...
27942,95,5,7,End flashback
27943,95,5,7,Ted: I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights.
27944,95,5,7,"Lily: Poor kid. This is how it will happen. They are the restau... (Lily imagines the scene) First, it rekindles debate US-Canada, when Alan Thicke, a native of Ontario, going to their table."
27945,95,5,7,Ted and Marshall's arrest.
27946,95,5,7,Ted: Alan Thicke?
27947,95,5,7,Marshall: Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang.
27948,95,5,7,"Lily: They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs. (She plunges into the scene) So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA / Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes."
27949,95,5,7,Ted: This is your masterpiece.
27950,95,5,7,Marshall: It takes a surveillance van!
27951,95,5,7,"Ted, Marshall and Lily are in a car"
27952,95,5,7,Marshall: A Break? Really? You have rented a station wagon?
27953,95,5,7,Ted: A van costs $ 25 more.
27954,95,5,7,Marshall: A Break?
27955,95,5,7,Marshall looks through binoculars and approaches a man in disguise.
27956,95,5,7,"Robot: Greeting, Will Robinson! That a birthday?"
27957,95,5,7,Lily: Get in the car.
27958,95,5,7,Ted: What is that thing?
27959,95,5,7,Lily: They did not stormtrooper so I had to take another robot. It will work also.
27960,95,5,7,Ted: Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots.

27964,95,5,7,Man: Someone ordered an extra large sausage?
27965,95,5,7,Ted: A film of Barney begins like that.
27966,95,5,7,Marshall: Barney Five... order something.
27967,95,5,7,Man: I do not know if everything will be back.
27968,95,5,7,Ted: Now you mention the movie.

27975,95,5,7,"Ted: If you work the costume, they will pay us."
27976,95,5,7,Marshall: Stop and think only of money.
27977,95,5,7,Lily: Give a hand to the stormtrooper.
27978,95,5,7,Ted and Marshall: It's not a stormtrooper.
27979,95,5,7,Man 2: Sorry for the delay. I was looking for a van.
27980,95,5,7,Marshall: Thank you!

27982,95,5,7,Man 2: I greet between Robin?
27983,95,5,7,"Lily: No, go up. Wait... When they blew the Death Star with thousands of stormtroopers it was human?"
27984,95,5,7,Marshall: It was the Death Star. They did not sign in the wind.

27986,95,5,7,Man: Someone should take this sausage!

27997,95,5,7,A woman comes in and does little to Marshall.
27998,95,5,7,Woman: I can go talk to Barney? I'm too excited. You really think he'll ask me to marry?
27999,95,5,7,"Marshall: Forget it is located. If you try something, they'll know it's us. We should all go..."
28000,95,5,7,Lily: This is my masterpiece. And then they saw us? It will work anyway.

28006,95,5,7,Lily: They kiss? They should not! Why it does not work?
28007,95,5,7,Ted: Because they love.
28008,95,5,7,Marshall: It was a bad spot.
28009,95,5,7,Lily: What am I doing? All this was a mistake.
28010,95,5,7,Robot: So... it tells you to smoke joints?
28011,95,5,7,"Marshall, Lily, Ted and Alan Thicke were at McLaren's."

28014,95,5,7,Robin joins them.
28015,95,5,7,Lily: Where is Barney?
28016,95,5,7,Robin: It was broken.
28017,95,5,7,Ted (2030): And that's when we have forgotten the lesson they had learned ten seconds.
28018,95,5,7,Flashback
28019,95,5,7,"Ted (2030): You see, rather in the evening, when Lily was believed that Barney and Robin had spotted us, this is what they really saw."
28020,95,5,7,"Barney, seeing himself in the window of the restaurant: Why this big and this old will not stop us... It's us!"
28021,95,5,7,Robin: Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?
28022,95,5,7,"Barney: I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not."
28023,95,5,7,"Robin: What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar."
28024,95,5,7,Barney: We love scotch. It is awesome.
28025,95,5,7,Robin: That might be it. There may be too great there.
28026,95,5,7,"Barney: Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled."
28027,95,5,7,Robin: Me too. We separate?
28028,95,5,7,Barney: I think. sh1t. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again.
28029,95,5,7,Robin: It's maybe not a break. This is perhaps... two friends... who find themselves.
28030,95,5,7,Alan Thicke: It's always nice to see a compatriot.
28031,95,5,7,Meg-the-crazy: Good news! I forgive you for that restraining order.
28032,95,5,7,Robin: It's a stormtrooper?
28033,95,5,7,Barney: It's not a stormtr... We're going from here?
28034,95,5,7,Alan Thicke: See you later.

28036,95,5,7,"Barney and Robin go hand in hand, and Alan and Meg-the-wild on their side."
28037,95,5,7,Meg-the-insane: You still live at 73rd Street?
28038,95,5,7,Alan: How do you know?
28039,95,5,7,Barney: Friends that are found. I like it.
28040,95,5,7,Robin: One for the Road?
28041,95,5,7,They kiss before leaving the restaurant.
28042,95,5,7,"Barney: And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone..."
28043,95,5,7,Robin: I am already involved with Ted.
28044,95,5,7,"Barney: It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone..."

28047,95,5,7,"Marshall: So, how is Barney?"
28048,95,5,7,"Robin: Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill?"
28049,95,5,7,Barney enters the McLaren's and everyone turns around. He again became slim.
28050,95,5,7,Barney: Dad returned.
28051,95,5,7,Alan: Content that is either mentioned it again.
28052,95,5,7,Robin: It is getting it soon.
28053,95,5,7,Lily: I love that you are always so many friends after this clip.
28054,95,5,7,"Alan: Clip? The video for ""Sandcastles""! It was also this together."
28055,95,5,7,"Barney: What do you mean ""too""?"
28056,95,5,7,Alan: We had this issue of Canadian variety that missed. It was so shameful. Imagine what would happen if someone put their hands on it?
28057,95,5,7,Robin: You then.
28058,95,5,7,Alan part. Robin and Barney sits down near the exit.
28059,96,5,8,"Ted (2030): Children, go out with someone for this is simple. We must be confident, good about yourself, and course of who you are. Uncle Barney was very good on this last point, although many times it was someone else."
28060,96,5,8,Barney is the bar disguised as a diver. Lily approaches a woman at the counter installed.
28061,96,5,8,Lily: You see that guy over there in diving suit? You think you're going to go talk to him?
28062,96,5,8,Woman: No.
28063,96,5,8,Lily: Okay. This is certainly the biggest con on this planet.
28064,96,5,8,Woman: How do you know?
28065,96,5,8,Lily: This is one of my best friends.
28066,96,5,8,Woman: And the diving suit?

28073,96,5,8,"Barney: All women of New York. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mother, lock your daughters. Daughters, lock your MAQACENJaR."
28074,96,5,8,Marshall: MAQACENJaR?
28075,96,5,8,"Ted: Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot."
28076,96,5,8,Barney: You have the right answer!
28077,96,5,8,"Lily: You're not rush a little, then?"
28078,96,5,8,"Barney: Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles."
28079,96,5,8,GENERIC
28080,96,5,8,"Barney: The Roles book contains all the scams, trickery, deception, underhand, cunning, nonsense, and embobinages tricks I used, or expected use, to nab the girls and do their business."
28081,96,5,8,Marshall: You're writing another book? Stephen King was one right there.
28082,96,5,8,"Barney: It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca..."

28087,96,5,8,Barney: This guy.
28088,96,5,8,"It shows Ted, who is dumped to the ground by a man."
28089,96,5,8,Woman: Thank you.

28095,96,5,8,"Ms. Stinsfire: Hello, girls!"
28096,96,5,8,Marshall: I do not see how it could not walk.
28097,96,5,8,Ted: What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
28098,96,5,8,"Barney: Glad you asked. The Lorenzon Von Matterhorn will be my comeback on stage. Or, you know, in my bed. In fact, my bed is on a stage. I put it on a platform and installed lighting. A real production. Barney goes!"
28099,96,5,8,He gets up from the couch and leaves.
28100,96,5,8,In McLaren's...
28101,96,5,8,Marshall: And you Robin? You leave it in play? Where is your book of Roles?
28102,96,5,8,"Robin: My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here."
28103,96,5,8,Ted: A great book.
28104,96,5,8,"Lily: Yeah, I'm reading it."
28105,96,5,8,"Robin: So, I have told you, I take a break on that side."
28106,96,5,8,Ted: It's going to happen.
28107,96,5,8,Marshall: Bluntly.
28108,96,5,8,Robin: What?
28109,96,5,8,Ted: You'll fall in love.
28110,96,5,8,Marshall: Very soon.
28111,96,5,8,"Robin: It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards."

28118,96,5,8,"Ted: It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature."
28119,96,5,8,Marshall: Judged. By nature.
28120,96,5,8,Ted: Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.
28121,96,5,8,Lily: Okay. Are you ready?
28122,96,5,8,Ted: Ready for what?
28123,96,5,8,"Lily: Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, ""It's perfect for Ted."""
28124,96,5,8,Ted: Why do not you talk to me now?
28125,96,5,8,"Three years earlier, Lily enters MacLaren's with Shelly."
28126,96,5,8,Shelly: I usually hate rencards arranged but Ted looks great.
28127,96,5,8,Lily: He is. It is so great and attentive and intelligent.
28128,96,5,8,Marshall: Another chicken and stick to you the crown!
28129,96,5,8,Ted tries to make the most of chicken fingers in his mouth.
28130,96,5,8,"Lily: I do not see it. It must be voluntary. So, another bar?"
28131,96,5,8,Lily leaves the bar with Shelly.
28132,96,5,8,"Ted, with chicken fingers in the mouth: This girl is super nice with Lily!"
28133,96,5,8,Ted: Yeah she was pretty.
28134,96,5,8,Lily: It still is. And you're ready.
28135,96,5,8,Marshall: But you can put three times more than chicken fingers in your mouth. You know.
28136,96,5,8,Lily: I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.
28137,96,5,8,Ted: I promise to do anything stupid.
28138,96,5,8,Ted (2030): And I kept that promise. But just because... it never came.
28139,96,5,8,A school where Lily works...

28143,96,5,8,Lily: You should! You should!
28144,96,5,8,"Shelly: This is the case, it does! This is false. I could not wait to meet Ted but I arrived at the bar an hour early and I met this great guy. Kind, serious genius."
28145,96,5,8,Lily: And you met him at McLaren's?
28146,96,5,8,Shelly: Just at the bar.
28147,96,5,8,Lily: What is the name there?
28148,96,5,8,Shelly: I should not say. And sh1t. This is Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!

Fine.Now choose your target. (It is now at the bar) Preferably a girl with a great big... phone. (He approaches the counter Shelly installed) Yeah that's me."

The fake of the Explorer Club newsletter on his trip to the North Pole in an airship, a feat of imagination and challenge. The fake medical journal with a story to make you cry the doctors saying that a reduction of the pen1s is not an option. And time to return...

28224,96,5,8,Woman: No? But we agreed. We always said we would meet again here. Tonight it. I'm an idiot.

28231,96,5,8,"Ted: Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours."
28232,96,5,8,Marshall: It's like that. Have you any idea how many times in my life when I went to look for frozen waffles frozen in vain?
28233,96,5,8,Robin: Thousands?
28234,96,5,8,"Marshall: Millions. But when I go in search of a mirror or the remote because Lily and I had an argument and she has hidden there, whereupon I fall? Frozen waffles. It's like that. You go out to get the newspaper, but you come back with frozen waffles.And there, frozen waffles he's a guy. As long as you're there, you take it back frozen waffles? And there, frozen waffles are... frozen waffles."

28251,96,5,8,Barney: An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag.
28252,96,5,8,Lily: I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see.
28253,96,5,8,Barney: You would not dare.
28254,96,5,8,"Lily: No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages."
28255,96,5,8,Barney: You did not say nonsense.

28275,96,5,8,Ted: He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.
28276,96,5,8,Marshall: It's not very well designed. This is not Ms. Stinsfire.
28277,96,5,8,Woman: And in real life?
28278,96,5,8,Lily: A few hours later...
28279,96,5,8,Flashback
28280,96,5,8,A knock on the door. Ted will open. Barney comes into diving suit.
28281,96,5,8,"Ted: Apparently, it will rain."
28282,96,5,8,"Barney: If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all."
28283,96,5,8,"He leaves, walking with fins."
28284,96,5,8,"Lily: It's good. I put the Book of Roles on the Internet. Baby, you can put the Book of Roles on the Internet?"
28285,96,5,8,"Marshall: Sure baby, but there is something odd. I flipped through the whole book. There is no role called The Diver."
28286,96,5,8,"Ted, Robin, Marshall and Lily have joined Barney at the bar."
28287,96,5,8,"Barney: Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible repérizzée."
28288,96,5,8,"Lily: Barney, no. You are..."
28289,96,5,8,"Barney: Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book."
28290,96,5,8,Robin: I did not worship the book.
28291,96,5,8,"Barney: But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular."
28292,96,5,8,"Robin: We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke."
28293,96,5,8,"Barney: I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed."
28294,96,5,8,"Everyone will sit at another table except Barney is left alone, and Lily goes to see the woman at the counter."

28300,96,5,8,Claire: Let's ask him.
28301,96,5,8,They joined Barney at his table.
28302,96,5,8,"Lily: So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing."
28303,96,5,8,"Barney: Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins bomb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind."
28304,96,5,8,Robin: It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships.
28305,96,5,8,Marshall: She is getting married.
28306,96,5,8,Ted: I will prepare my toast.
28307,96,5,8,Marshall: I have to check my tuxedo.
28308,96,5,8,Robin: I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.
28309,96,5,8,"Lily: I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles."
28310,96,5,8,"Barney: Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee?"
28311,96,5,8,"Lily: Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks..."

28313,96,5,8,Lily:... is an incredible kind. He's funny and it's one of my best friends. And he came out with this gun.
28314,96,5,8,Robin: It's a good guy.
28315,96,5,8,"Ted: Come on, go out with him."
28316,96,5,8,"Marshall: It's a coffee, huh?"
28317,96,5,8,Robin: It's nothing.
28318,96,5,8,"Claire: Okay, okay. Going for coffee."
28319,96,5,8,Ted (2030): And at the end of the evening...
28320,96,5,8,Barney share in the company of Claire.
28321,96,5,8,Marshall: I'm proud of him. It takes a lot of Pringles to be as vulnerable.
28322,96,5,8,"Lily: I had a message from Barney. ""Look under the table."" (She looks under the table and finds an envelope) A page from the Book of Roles."
28323,96,5,8,Robin: It says what?

Your friend, let's call her Lily, told him everything about the book. Now the hard part.When Lily and daughter are questioning The Diver, remove the mask, and pull out the stops on your deepest insecurities that do not exist because you are awesome. Sad for you, Lily talks about you to the girl who agrees to have coffee. And... is... gone."

28333,96,5,8,Robin: I will not fall in love with him.

28336,96,5,8,"Robin: No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so..."
28337,96,5,8,"Marshall: Right, because here it is. It is this type! (A woman enters) Let him at least a chance. Get out a bit with it, see if it can give something."
28338,96,5,8,Robin: I will work.
28339,96,5,8,"Marshall: Yeah, right."
28340,96,5,8,Robin: I'm really going to work.

28343,96,5,8,"Man: You, Robin?"
28344,96,5,8,Robin: Yes.

28349,97,5,9,"Marshall out of a taxi, the phone to your ear."
28350,97,5,9,"Marshall: It's beautiful. She is 10 pounds. It is organic. Do you remember my uncle Heinrek bald? Looks like his head squarely.(The taxi hand) Oh, my God! My my turkey... turkey!"
28351,97,5,9,He runs behind the cab to try to catch up.
28352,97,5,9,"Ted (2030): So when we got to the big day, Marshall was rather depressed."
28353,97,5,9,Ted and Robin arrive at Lily and Marshall where Barney is already there.
28354,97,5,9,Robin: We brought the turkey.
28355,97,5,9,Marshall: You have brought back an old turkey replacement.Why I have not listened to the message of former mayor Ed Koch saying not to forget my business.
28356,97,5,9,"Robin Marshall, you do not understand."
28357,97,5,9,"Ted: With Robin we went to the objects found in the prefecture and there, sitting in their fridge... Is this your turkey?"
28358,97,5,9,"Marshall: Yes! It's my turkey! Come here, my beautiful little enfoirée!"
28359,97,5,9,Lily: I'll go put it in the oven.
28360,97,5,9,Marshall: You're the best friends in the world!
28361,97,5,9,Marshall takes Robin and Ted in his arms.
28362,97,5,9,Barney: It was a team effort.
28363,97,5,9,Barney is going to give them a hug but Ted pushes.
28364,97,5,9,"Marshall: I do not know what to say. It's Thanksgiving, but ""thank you"" does not seem enough."
28365,97,5,9,Ted: You have done the same for us.
28366,97,5,9,"Marshall: Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap."

28371,97,5,9,"Ted (2030): When Barney lost, Marshall has earned the right to slap Barney five times as hard as he can. Until then, he had used three. The third was issued two years ago at Thanksgiving 2007. A day was appointed... Baffegiving."
28372,97,5,9,End flashback
28373,97,5,9,Ted: You're saying...
28374,97,5,9,Robin: What you think you say?
28375,97,5,9,"Marshall: Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... ""Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower"" in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying!"
28376,97,5,9,Barney: The slaps are not transferable.
28377,97,5,9,Marshall: Lily is the curator of the bet.
28378,97,5,9,Lily: The slaps are transferable.
28379,97,5,9,Robin and Ted: Transferable.
28380,97,5,9,Robin: You realize that you will remain one. Are you sure you want to spend a day.
28381,97,5,9,"Marshall: Life is short. I tell myself, Baffe Diem. A rule, the slap must be given before sunset to avoid interference dinner Lily."
28382,97,5,9,Lily: And how!
28383,97,5,9,"Marshall: Two, you must decide which of you will. Three, we will attach to the chair Barney, now be called The Throne of Baffe. It fits you?"
28384,97,5,9,Lily: Awesome.
28385,97,5,9,Barney: Absolutely not!
28386,97,5,9,Ted (2030): Everything was in place for this to be the best Thanksgiving. Until...
28387,97,5,9,We rang the doorbell.
28388,97,5,9,Lily: We expect someone else?
28389,97,5,9,Ted (2030): It was someone with whom Lily had had no contact in three years.
28390,97,5,9,Lily opens the door.

28415,97,5,9,Lily: What has happened?
28416,97,5,9,Mickey: He wanted me to pay rent. It has ended badly.
28417,97,5,9,Lily: You should pay rent to live in the basement of your parents.
28418,97,5,9,Mickey: It's not my first choice. With the old schnoques up there it's a little disturbing. They do not understand the trick of the sock on the handle.
28419,97,5,9,Marshall: They surprised you with a girl?
28420,97,5,9,Mickey: In a sense.
28421,97,5,9,Grandfather soon sweetie. I go to work.
28422,97,5,9,Lily: Working? You are retired.
28423,97,5,9,Grandfather: Now that I have another mouth to feed I had to return to the mill. Where is my truss?

28444,97,5,9,"Marshall: Lily, go. It's been 3 years. This is long enough."
28445,97,5,9,Lily: The equity in my life brings me nothing but stress. It's easier that he is dead to me.

28475,97,5,9,Marshall: He was trying to earn money to feed his family.
28476,97,5,9,"Lily: No, that's what mom was doing with his two jobs. This man broke my heart every day for 20 years."

28483,97,5,9,Barney: And finish it!
28484,97,5,9,Robin: It's all yours.
28485,97,5,9,"Ted: No. To you, I insist."
28486,97,5,9,"Robin: Okay, I will."
28487,97,5,9,"Ted: Great. Wait, what?"
28488,97,5,9,Robin: I say I'll slap.
28489,97,5,9,"Ted: What, so it's... the end of the discussion?"
28490,97,5,9,Robin: You said I could slap.
28491,97,5,9,"Ted: I was polite. If someone will slap, it will be me."
28492,97,5,9,"Robin: No, not at all."
28493,97,5,9,Barney: This is interesting.
28494,97,5,9,
28495,97,5,9,In the room of Marshall and Lily...
28496,97,5,9,Marshall: It's your family. And I'm sorry but we do not separate the family.
28497,97,5,9,"Lily: It's easy for you to say that, you come to the family the most ridiculously close to the world."
28498,97,5,9,Marshall: It is not ridiculously close.
28499,97,5,9,Lily: Really? And the Eriksen family dinner every Sunday?
28500,97,5,9,Flashback
28501,97,5,9,"Marshall's parents, the family is at the table."
28502,97,5,9,"Father: Everything looks delicious, mom Eriksen."
28503,97,5,9,"Mother: Thank you, daddy bear. Marshall, will you say grace?"
28504,97,5,9,"Marshall, in video on the computer: Well, I would be happy, Mom. Everyone, please, give your hands. Dear Lord..."
28505,97,5,9,End flashback
28506,97,5,9,Lily: I'm sorry but it's weird.
28507,97,5,9,Marshall: A family must be close like that. And I want our future family is. And that includes your father.
28508,97,5,9,"Lily: I can not believe you take her part. Let me be clear. This man will never set foot in this house, ever!"
28509,97,5,9,Marshall opens the door.
28510,97,5,9,Marshall: It will take about 5 minutes.
28511,97,5,9,"Mickey, sitting on the floor: I hope it's soon. I lose the war against hemorrhoids."
28512,97,5,9,Marshall: It's a disease?
28513,97,5,9,Mickey: No.
28514,97,5,9,He closes the door. Then leaves the room to join Lily.
28515,97,5,9,"Robin: We have one hour before sunset, and none of us baffera Barney."
28516,97,5,9,Ted: Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.
28517,97,5,9,Barney: It's a good point. Rebuttal?
28518,97,5,9,Robin: I slipped a note of the type 20!
28519,97,5,9,Barney: philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments.
28520,97,5,9,Ted: I brought this large turkey so far.
28521,97,5,9,Robin: I paid the taxi.
28522,97,5,9,Ted: You've slept with one of my best friends!
28523,97,5,9,Robin: What? You said it was fine.
28524,97,5,9,"Ted: Well, no!"
28525,97,5,9,Robin: Why did not you say anything?
28526,97,5,9,Ted: Because I love you always!
28527,97,5,9,Robin: You really want to slap Barney the point of lying and pretending to be in love with me?
28528,97,5,9,Ted: I really want to slap!
28529,97,5,9,Lily brings the turkey on the table.
28530,97,5,9,"Marshall: Your father has made mistakes in the past, but it has changed. He moved out of your grandparents. He has a job. He pays his taxes."
28531,97,5,9,"Lily: Wait, how you know all this?"
28532,97,5,9,"Marshall: Gender, body language. Okay, we had a drink last week."
28533,97,5,9,Flashback
28534,97,5,9,Marshall is with McLaren's Lily's father.
28535,97,5,9,Mickey: I miss her so much. My little princess. She talks about me?
28536,97,5,9,"Marshall: Yeah, kind, all the time. She tells this story all the time..."
28537,97,5,9,Mickey: Never?
28538,97,5,9,"Marshall: No, not a word. But that does not have to be like that.We can fix that, right?"
28539,97,5,9,"Mickey: I always thought it would arrange the marriage. I even wrote a speech. But hey, not invited '. Thin, I have not even seen the wedding photo."
28540,97,5,9,"Marshall: And right before my eyes, your father broke down in tears. (Actually, it's Marshall who starts crying) Stop it! You come to Thanksgiving!"
28541,97,5,9,End flashback
28542,97,5,9,Lily: You've invited?!
28543,97,5,9,"Marshall: The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified."
28544,97,5,9,Lily: I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that?
28545,97,5,9,Marshall: You and I are married. So it is also part of my family.(Marshall will open the door for the third time) Enter.
28546,97,5,9,Lily left the apartment.
28547,97,5,9,"Robin, Marshall, Ted and Mickey playing a game of it."
28548,97,5,9,"Mickey: Ted, you should play quickly. Your gallbladder is about to explode."
28549,97,5,9,Marshall: It must be half an hour. We should get Lily.
28550,97,5,9,Mickey: You have to let it calm down. Finish the game.
28551,97,5,9,Barney: Repeat-a. The first seven!
28552,97,5,9,Ted: Robin sh1t! I knew Barney first. This is for me to slap.
28553,97,5,9,"Robin: This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt."
28554,97,5,9,Ted: I want to slap Barney since I met him!
28555,97,5,9,Robin: And I would not slap?
28556,97,5,9,"Ted: One second. This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and it has turned against each other."
28557,97,5,9,"Robin: My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it."
28558,97,5,9,Ted: Are you sure?
28559,97,5,9,Robin: Baffe-solument.
28560,97,5,9,Marshall: We should really get Lily.
28561,97,5,9,"Mickey: Ted, gall bladder about to fart."
28562,97,5,9,"Ted: It's decided. Barney, go. Come on the throne."
28563,97,5,9,Barney: You're gonna...
28564,97,5,9,Ted: Yep. Go.
28565,97,5,9,"Barney: I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women."
28566,97,5,9,"Barney is on ""the throne""."
28567,97,5,9,Ted: Do not listen. It's decided.
28568,97,5,9,"Barney: And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps."
28569,97,5,9,Robin: Leads to me!
28570,97,5,9,Ted holds it.
28571,97,5,9,"Ted: Robin! Pull yourself together! (The timer sounds and ""something sprung from the game) What just happened?"
28572,97,5,9,"Mickey: Sorry, Ted. Explosion of the gallbladder. You stand back 3 spaces."
28573,97,5,9,Marshall: You come here and you watch your daughter go without care. And now you destroy the Thanksgiving dinner! Lily is on it since this morning!
28574,97,5,9,Mickey: Relax. This is not true of bile. It is of Chinese painting to lead. And bile horse.
28575,97,5,9,"Ted (2030): And at that time, Marshall is launching a look at Mickey none of us had ever seen."
28576,97,5,9,Mickey: What is it? It does what?
28577,97,5,9,Ted: You have swallowed this painting?
28578,97,5,9,"Marshall: This is my look ""you're dead to me."""
28579,97,5,9,"Mickey: Yeah, Lily does it better..."
28580,97,5,9,Marshall: Get out of my house!
28581,97,5,9,Marshall finds Lily at the grocery store.
28582,97,5,9,"Marshall: In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again. (Lily starts to cry) What? Baby, what has happened?"
28583,97,5,9,"Lily: Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father."
28584,97,5,9,Marshall takes off his coat and gave it to Lily.
28585,97,5,9,"Ted (2030): And that's the way to Thanksgiving 2009, your aunt Lily was a miracle. (Lily and Marshall arrive at the door of their apartment, when Mickey's father, Lily, was released. She throws herself into his arms) It has brought a man to life."
28586,97,5,9,"Entire band, and the father of Lily are at the table."
28587,97,5,9,"Marshall, tapping on a glass: Everyone. Before we begin, Barney, we'll need you on the throne of Baffe."
28588,97,5,9,"Barney: Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation..."
28589,97,5,9,"Lily: Less talking shop, more slaps."
28590,97,5,9,Marshall: You just 2 minutes. You decided which of you will be entitled to a slap in the face to Barney?
28591,97,5,9,"It attaches to Barney ""Throne""."
28592,97,5,9,Robin: It's gonna be Ted.
28593,97,5,9,Ted: What? Why me?
28594,97,5,9,"Robin: Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can."
28595,97,5,9,Ted: Thank you.
28596,97,5,9,Barney: This is the worst.
28597,97,5,9,Ted gets up and is about to slap Barney when he stops.
28598,97,5,9,"Ted: You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Barney are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?"
28599,97,5,9,Robin: Yes
28600,97,5,9,Ted: I know.
28601,97,5,9,Barney: It's downright hell.
28602,97,5,9,Ted and Robin hug.
28603,97,5,9,Ted: Okay.
28604,97,5,9,Robin is about to slap...
28605,97,5,9,Barney: It hurts!
28606,97,5,9,"Robin: I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted."
28607,97,5,9,Ted: I do not either.
28608,97,5,9,Barney: thank you God.
28609,97,5,9,"Robin: So, I want to move. Mickey?"
28610,97,5,9,Barney: No way!
28611,97,5,9,"Robin: I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap."
28612,97,5,9,"Mickey: Really? It's a bit weird for me, I just met Barney and I have nothing against him but how many times have we a chance to slap someone in the face?"
28613,97,5,9,It stretches and then...
28614,97,5,9,Barney: Gently!
28615,97,5,9,Mickey: I'm sorry. I can not do it.
28616,97,5,9,Barney: thank you God.
28617,97,5,9,Mickey: I know I have not been a good father.
28618,97,5,9,Barney: You're kidding me.
28619,97,5,9,"Mickey: So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you... I give you, to you This slap."
28620,97,5,9,"Barney: No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!"
28621,97,5,9,Lily: The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.
28622,97,5,9,Barney: It's not good. Please... Let me...
28623,97,5,9,Lily: Close your eyes. It will soon be over.
28624,97,5,9,It warms the hand and stops.
28625,97,5,9,Barney: I'm running in a meadow.
28626,97,5,9,Lily: I can not do it. Why I can not do it?
28627,97,5,9,Marshall: Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.
28628,97,5,9,Barney: Stop your bullshit.
28629,97,5,9,Marshall: And so... there will not slap... of... today.
28630,97,5,9,"It separates the Barney ""Throne""."
28631,97,5,9,Barney: This is the best Thanksgiving...
28632,97,5,9,"Barney and Marshall gets up the slap, knocking him to the ground."
28633,97,5,9,Marshall: 4! So the turkey?
28634,97,5,9,"Voices: A new home Aldrin Games, is... The Bet-Baffe! The game of happy slaps which is a box. (Children are playing, and a little boy slap a girl, then they laugh) You got slap. Right in the face, my friend... For children of all ages. You got slap. It really happened... Everyone saw! Everyone laughed and applauded because it was great..."
28635,97,5,9,Boy: I won!
28636,97,5,9,"Voice:... The way you got yourself slap. Baffez you like crazy with the Pari-Baffe, Aldrin in a carton. No child was slap while filming the ad."
28637,98,5,10,Ted's apartment
28638,98,5,10,"Marshall: Well, I received another."
28639,98,5,10,Robin: What's there in the box? What there was in the boiiite?What there was in the boiiiiiite?! What there was in the boiiiiiiite?! Not bad eh? Nothing. I'm the idiot huh? What there was in the box?
28640,98,5,10,"Ted: Since Lily and Marshall have their apartment, her mother keeps sending him old things she wants to get rid."
28641,98,5,10,"Marshall: Well done 'man, right on target this time. I really needed the right arm of Himan, and this old book of Mad Libs.Pet went to fart to fart loud. This is good. Thank you 'man."
28642,98,5,10,The phone rings and Ted wins.
28643,98,5,10,Ted: Hello?
28644,98,5,10,Older woman: Ted Mosby?
28645,98,5,10,Ted: Yes.
28646,98,5,10,Elderly Woman: The window is open.
28647,98,5,10,Ted: What?
28648,98,5,10,Elderly Woman: The window is open.
28649,98,5,10,Ted: The window is open.
28650,98,5,10,"Marshall: What are you waiting for? Ted, run!"
28651,98,5,10,Ted puts his jacket over and out of the apartment.
28652,98,5,10,"Ted: Lily, the window is open. Fight your way, watercourse Ted, run!"
28653,98,5,10,He runs and then arrives at an apartment where a young woman comes out.
28654,98,5,10,Woman: Ted?
28655,98,5,10,"Ted: Hey, Maggie. I was just, you know, hmm... How are you?"
28656,98,5,10,"Maggie: I think I'm fine. Actually no, I'm not well. I just broke up with my boyfriend."
28657,98,5,10,"Ted: Oh, sorry for you. Wanna go out tonight?"
28658,98,5,10,"Maggie: Yes, of course."
28659,98,5,10,GENERIC
28660,98,5,10,The band is at McLaren's.
28661,98,5,10,"Marshall: Come on, tell me that happened to you on time?"
28662,98,5,10,Ted: I arrived!
28663,98,5,10,Robin: What's happening? What is this window?
28664,98,5,10,"Ted: You see how everyone knows a person, and whatever happens, this person is perfect for you."
28665,98,5,10,Robin: My cats.
28666,98,5,10,Marshall: Lily.
28667,98,5,10,Barney: That girl over there.
28668,98,5,10,Ted: Well this girl was and still is Maggie Wilks.
28669,98,5,10,"Marshall: We went to college together, she's great. Everybody liked him."
28670,98,5,10,Barney: Oh I know what we do here. Tell me when it stops.
28671,98,5,10,Ted: It was not the fact that Maggie was good. It was the...
28672,98,5,10,Marshall: It was the perfect girl next door.
28673,98,5,10,"Ted: It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time."
28674,98,5,10,Flashback
28675,98,5,10,Ted goes to Maggie.
28676,98,5,10,"Ted: When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years."
28677,98,5,10,End flashback
28678,98,5,10,"Ted: The third time, I was super fast. I got not even one hour after their breakup. The only thing she has made between the break and I arrived, it's down to her mail."
28679,98,5,10,Flashback
28680,98,5,10,"Ted: Late again. And she went out with him four years. I would not let me have it again. So I begged her neighbor, Ms. Doglas, call me when she and David have broken loose."
28681,98,5,10,End flashback
28682,98,5,10,"Ted: And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far."
28683,98,5,10,"Barney: Even when I arrived here, she still will not touch with a man. I feel good tonight, this evening will be well."
28684,98,5,10,"Marshall: This is my overalls. I wore this little baby, during high school."
28685,98,5,10,"Robin: Hey, you were really a virgin before he met Lily."
28686,98,5,10,Marshall: It was not necessary.
28687,98,5,10,"Lily: She's right baby, if you had worn it in college, even I would not have slept with you. And if you remember, I wanted to."
28688,98,5,10,"Barney: No way, no one could sleep while wearing it. Challenge accepted. I, Barney Stinson, brilliant mind in an extraordinary body, this will overalls, and lie with a woman."
28689,98,5,10,Robin: I went out with this guy.
28690,98,5,10,"Ted: Ok, game plan Maggie arrives, a few minutes of gathering and presentation, and everyone leaves us. This is my only chance, and I will not go wrong."
28691,98,5,10,Robin: You do not give a lecture tonight?
28692,98,5,10,Ted: Damn!
28693,98,5,10,"Lily: Oh my God, good evening."
28694,98,5,10,Maggie arrives.
28695,98,5,10,"Ted: I want you to Maggie Robin, my roommate."
28696,98,5,10,Maggie: Nice to meet you.
28697,98,5,10,Robin: Likewise.
28698,98,5,10,"Ted: I completely forgot, I teach a class tonight. How would you like to come and see what happens during an architecture?"
28699,98,5,10,"Maggie: Ooh, not even a little. I'll stick with Marshall and Lily, that's fine."
28700,98,5,10,"Ted: Super. Sit down, put yourself at ease. Relaxed, everything is relaxed. Listen, you want me to find the perfect girl for you so all together, it's her. Do not let a guy to approach her. No server to take our order, clean the table, and if it ignites, I want a female firefighter to extinguish."
28701,98,5,10,Marshall: I think that emergencies are taking applications like that.
28702,98,5,10,"Ted: Marshall Good God, do what you need to keep single until my return. I pay the bill, but do not abuse."
28703,98,5,10,Ted leaves for his course.
28704,98,5,10,Marshall and Lily are in front of the toilet bar.
28705,98,5,10,Marshall: Target secure?
28706,98,5,10,Lily: Target secure.
28707,98,5,10,"Marshall: Wow, weird, pulled out all the toilets at the same time."
28708,98,5,10,Lily: Let's go to the table all together.
28709,98,5,10,"Marshall: Look at that, our table."
28710,98,5,10,"Lily, a man: Get out!"
28711,98,5,10,Barney arrives at the bar with the overalls of Marshall.
28712,98,5,10,Robin: Your challenge not interest me but you're cheating. Wear a suit under the overalls.
28713,98,5,10,"Barney: No. They are called not on the shirt, or on t-shirts for wholesale repairing the car and my mother spent some time with her top. They are called overalls, and I can relate to what I want."
28714,98,5,10,"Robin: Oh it does not tell you goodnight, he tells you how he feeds his horses. I could sit there and tell jokes Farmer on you all night. Challenge accepted."
28715,98,5,10,Ted can continue.
28716,98,5,10,"Ted: Good evening, tonight we will quickly see the different bridges. There are 6 types of bridges, small, large, with suspension and three others. You land on each side and water in the middle. See you next week."
28717,98,5,10,Student: It was a course of 1 hour.
28718,98,5,10,Ted: Who wants to hear me talk about bridges for 1 hour? (All raise their hands) Really?
28719,98,5,10,"At the bar, Marshall and Lily always watch Maggie."
28720,98,5,10,Lily: I just remembered how Ted is awesome.
28721,98,5,10,Maggie: Bizarre as drinking game.
28722,98,5,10,Barney: I offer you a drink?
28723,98,5,10,Robin: It was a big tractor 3-axis.
28724,98,5,10,Barney: What do I do?
28725,98,5,10,Architecture course Ted.
28726,98,5,10,Ted: One important thing to remember when designing a bridge.
28727,98,5,10,Student: Maggie?
28728,98,5,10,"Ted: No. Finally yes. When you design a bridge remember: ""Make Adjustments... Fetch energetically"" (""Make Ajustments Energize Go Get It"" Maggie acronym in English) Good advice in general too."
28729,98,5,10,"Student: Professor Mosby, Maggie is someone special?"
28730,98,5,10,"Ted: No, I mean it's just that girl that interests me very long time.And tonight this is my chance to get away with it."
28731,98,5,10,Student 2: It's Good?
28732,98,5,10,"Ted: Yes Jamie, she is very pretty. We can now finish the course. Betty?"
28733,98,5,10,"Betty: Maggie is finally free, but you Professor, are you ready for a serious relationship?"
28734,98,5,10,"Ted: Bluntly. I think. Perhaps. I dunno, you think what?"
28735,98,5,10,In McLaren's...
28736,98,5,10,"Marshall: Oh my God, I had totally forgotten that."
28737,98,5,10,Maggie: What is it?
28738,98,5,10,"Marshall: A duty that day of my 15 years. Write a letter to your future you with a list of things you hope to do. ""Dear Future Me..."""
28739,98,5,10,Flashback
28740,98,5,10,"In 1993, Marshall is in his room at his desk, dressed in his overalls and he writes."
28741,98,5,10,"Marshall: ""... you better drive a camaro or a super van. This is priority numero uno. And your ponytail should happen to you at the knees. You can always dunk course and change your name to ""Vanilla Thunder"". Your wife, girlfriend, 1m80, a great body and take care of yourself. """

28743,98,5,10,Marshall: Sorry darling.
28744,98,5,10,"Lily: No problem, you just described your mother."
28745,98,5,10,Maggie: Continuous.
28746,98,5,10,Flashback
28747,98,5,10,"Marshall: ""You still wear overalls faded because it looks torn.And more importantly, you better save the world, and if you became a poor guy then throw yourself off a cliff, because you suck. And I ""Licky boom boom down""."
28748,98,5,10,End flashback
28749,98,5,10,Lily and Maggie laughs the last sentence of Marshall.
28750,98,5,10,"Marshall: Yes that's right, it's hilarious, I became a business poor guy. I work for GNB, the bank most unhealthy existence."
28751,98,5,10,"Maggie: Oh come on Thunder vanilla, everyone should grow up and get a job."
28752,98,5,10,"Lily: I remember in college, Maggie wanted to be a marine biologist by day and tutor children in difficulty at night. What you ended up doing?"
28753,98,5,10,Maggie: These things.
28754,98,5,10,Marshall rises.
28755,98,5,10,"Lily: Baby, where you going?"
28756,98,5,10,"Marshall: I have to do something at work, it will not be long."
28757,98,5,10,Maggie: What did he?
28758,98,5,10,"Lily: Oh no, I think he'll resign. Sorry Maggie, I have to go stop him. (Lily comes out in pursuit of Marshall, leaving Maggie alone. A man turns to Maggie) Ted I had to leave the bar but it's good she is with Robin."
28759,98,5,10,Ted: You're left with Maggie Robin?
28760,98,5,10,"Robin: Relax, everything is under control."
28761,98,5,10,"Ted: You do not understand, this girl is like a magnet to men... overkill."
28762,98,5,10,Robin: I know a little something about loving to men... you see me as one of those magnets that can not put a picture of your children on the fridge. But I am one of these magnets... that can pick up cars in scrap yards...! (Robin returns to the table where she finds a man with Maggie) Who is it?
28763,98,5,10,"Maggie: Robin, this is a good friend of Jim's work."
28764,98,5,10,"Robin: Oh, well... hello you!"
28765,98,5,10,"Jim, without looking at Enchanted!"
28766,98,5,10,During Ted...
28767,98,5,10,"Ted: What does mean to be ready? I thought I was ready last year and I was left on the altar. I'll be honest. I'm scared! Ok, Luis and Betty!"
28768,98,5,10,"Luis: We're all scared, Professor Mosby."
28769,98,5,10,Betty: Do not be afraid you did not know that it's something important?
28770,98,5,10,"Ted: I mean, if you're not afraid you do not try your luck... and if you do not try your luck then... What are you doing? Not?"
28771,98,5,10,Jamie: I think you're ready buddy.
28772,98,5,10,
28773,98,5,10,"At the bar, Maggie laughs with Jim and Robin watching."
28774,98,5,10,Maggie: You're too funny!
28775,98,5,10,"Robin: Funny? I think it's hilarious. In fact, I liked so much that I think I'm pissed."
28776,98,5,10,Jim: I'd better go. I go to the first of this photo exhibition we talked about at work. I have a ticket if you want more?
28777,98,5,10,Robin: I'd love to!
28778,98,5,10,Ted is about to leave.
28779,98,5,10,"Ted: Ok, I gotta go!"
28780,98,5,10,Jamie: Just one last tip: M.A...
28781,98,5,10,All:... G.G.I.E!
28782,98,5,10,His phone rings.
28783,98,5,10,Ted: Hello?
28784,98,5,10,"Robin: Ted, change of plans!"
28785,98,5,10,She is out with Jim ready to take a taxi.
28786,98,5,10,Ted: You let him with Barney?
28787,98,5,10,"Barney: Ted, will you calm down? I'm your pal!"
28788,98,5,10,Ted: You're an animal!
28789,98,5,10,"Barney: And I know our relationship has suffered in this area, I assure you I'll be the perfect gentleman."
28790,98,5,10,"Maggie: Thank you! In fact, I love this bib!"
28791,98,5,10,"Barney: You have 10 minutes to get here, the window closes."
28792,98,5,10,Ted: 10 minutes?
28793,98,5,10,"Barney: Yeah, because we're friends!"
28794,98,5,10,Ted Short.
28795,98,5,10,"Ted (2030): While I was running through the city to return to the bar, your Aunt Robin was doing his best to keep Jim away from Maggie."
28796,98,5,10,Robin is the photo exhibition with Jim.
28797,98,5,10,"Jim: You could go to the bar, Maggie is still there?"
28798,98,5,10,"Robin: Oh, it's not possible! I love pictures of dogs ironic. You got it there with the dog Welsh dwarf who is a missionary?"
28799,98,5,10,"Jim: I'll take a taxi, I feel bad for leaving Maggie alone."
28800,98,5,10,"Robin: And if you took a glass of wine first? (It shatters his glass on it voluntarily) Oooh boy! I'm dirty, it's me! I'm just a dirty, dirty girl... that would defeat the second base with a friend of a friend.Tui love it! It's pig!"
28801,98,5,10,Jim: I'll call Maggie to see what it does.
28802,98,5,10,"Robin: Oh my God, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Leave her alone!Lord, she goes out with Ted tonight."
28803,98,5,10,Jim: Ted? And Devon?
28804,98,5,10,Robin: They have broken.
28805,98,5,10,Jim: Maggie is single?
28806,98,5,10,Robin: It tells me nothing!
28807,98,5,10,Jim hand and the server comes to Robin with a cloth to wipe her her dress.
28808,98,5,10,Server: I can remove it? Please?
28809,98,5,10,"Ted, always current: I hate Barney Stinson!"
28810,98,5,10,Voice: Me too!
28811,98,5,10,Ted (2030): Lily finally arrived at GNB. But the place was deserted.
28812,98,5,10,Lily Marshall is on a basketball court.
28813,98,5,10,Lily: Hey baby! I thought you came here to resign... I forgot the basket.
28814,98,5,10,"Marshall: Yeah, I thought so... so I got to do something on this list I will feel more so old so I... I came here to dunk."
28815,98,5,10,Lily: Do it helped you feel better?
28816,98,5,10,Marshall: I just touches the bottom of the net. You know my legs are so bad that I have a hard time getting approved.
28817,98,5,10,In McLaren's...
28818,98,5,10,Barney: Really...
28819,98,5,10,Ted comes running at the bar.
28820,98,5,10,Ted: How could you?
28821,98,5,10,"Barney: I'm challenged to have s*x with overalls. And if you stay on my path, then you let Barney win. And you do not want that!This place will never tell us the end of history."
28822,98,5,10,Jim: Thank God! Maggie! (Ted and Barney stops him) I love that girl.
28823,98,5,10,Ted: Put yourself on the line Bob!
28824,98,5,10,"Barney: Yeah, I'll sleep with her. After, he'll tell her he loves her.And you can do... what you want. Is there agreement on the order?"
28825,98,5,10,"Robin, Jim: Sir! You just missed... the night of your life! The night... of your life."
28826,98,5,10,Jim: I'm in love with her for 5 years!
28827,98,5,10,Ted: I'm in love with her for 12 years!
28828,98,5,10,Barney: I wear this jumpsuit since 1:30!
28829,98,5,10,Marshall and Lily are always the basketball court.
28830,98,5,10,"Lily: Maybe you can not dunk now. But you did more in 30 years that this 15 year old could have dreamed. You are a graduate of law. You had the good sense to cut you that stupid ponytail. And, you married this super bomb that is unlike any points to your mother. This entitles you to 30 cm less to dunk. (She drops a little basket) Go ahead Thunder vanilla!"
28831,98,5,10,Marshall: remote!
28832,98,5,10,"He rushes forward, touches the bottom of the net and falls."
28833,98,5,10,"Lily: Oh, Baby! And if instead of going to dunk on your desk... you allongeras and I'd put the banana oil everywhere?"
28834,98,5,10,Marshall: Sure baby. Why we would not do that here?
28835,98,5,10,Lily: Sure baby.
28836,98,5,10,"At the Bar, Ted, Barney and Jim will argue that Maggie."
28837,98,5,10,"Ted: Guys, guys, guys! We must fix that."
28838,98,5,10,Jim: We continue to negotiate until we have a very small window of opportunity.
28839,98,5,10,"Barney: Guys, let me assure you that if you let me... the window will reopen in about 10 minutes."
28840,98,5,10,"Ted: Wait, where is Maggie?"
28841,98,5,10,Robin: She's gone!
28842,98,5,10,Ted: What?
28843,98,5,10,Robin: I told him to return. You were like vultures... fighting for his carcass. Let her be single for once.
28844,98,5,10,Jim: What enfoirée!
28845,98,5,10,"Ted: Wait, she's right. Maggie deserves a little time for her.Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a break but... This is where we discover who we really are... and what you really want. She deserves it!"
28846,98,5,10,"Ted (2030): Children, I thought. That's why I'm not proud of what he was after..."
28847,98,5,10,Ted runs out followed by Jim and Barney.
28848,98,5,10,"Ted, in front of Maggie: It was after the corner!"
28849,98,5,10,He knocks on the door behind him and Jim Barney.
28850,98,5,10,"Ted: Oh, sorry, the course we had a little... Who is it?"
28851,98,5,10,"Maggie: It's Adam. It's crazy, we grew up together was not forced to see since..."
28852,98,5,10,Adam: Very long time!
28853,98,5,10,Ted (2030):... That's when Maggie told us the second most beautiful love story I heard.
28854,98,5,10,Flashback
28855,98,5,10,We see the story of Maggie and Adam take place over the years.
28856,98,5,10,End flashback
28857,98,5,10,Adam: I just moved to town and I've grown up a bit.
28858,98,5,10,Maggie: I think you have much to catch up.
28859,98,5,10,"Ted: Yeah, sure!"
28860,98,5,10,"Ted (2030): So the kids, I'm left with... the neighbor because the neighbor."
28861,98,5,10,Ted: Well... I'll see you next time!
28862,98,5,10,Ted (2030): There was never a next time. The window of Maggie never reopened.
28863,98,5,10,"Barney: Well, I found! There are bars country, ""the giddy ups"", there are tons of guys in overalls. Copilot me!"
28864,98,5,10,"Ted: I do not want the ""giddy ups."" That's what I want. I had forgotten how it felt to seeking the real thing... but I think I'm ready again."
28865,98,5,10,"Barney: Let me tell you where I am... I want to sleep with a girl in order to remove this jumpsuit. (From Ted) Go, go. You gotta help me, I have to remove this damn thing."
28866,98,5,10,Older woman: Hey you! I love your overalls!
28867,98,5,10,"At the bar, Marshall wrote a letter to him his future."
28868,98,5,10,"Marshall: Dear Marshall 60 years... Now you would work in a place that contributes to a better world. Or at least you try. No pressure man! I mean, sir. So... If time travel is possible, could you give me a little sign? Tuesday, December 8 at 8:29 p.m....."
28869,98,5,10,"Lily: Someone sent these chicken wings because they were too hot. I do... too hot, you're crazy? So chicken wings free."
28870,98,5,10,"Marshall: Old Marshall, as long as you're married to Lily you'll be fine."
28871,98,5,10,"Waitress at the old Marshall: Sir, it is for us. Sorry that the wings were so hot."
28872,98,5,10,"Old Marshall: Oh dear, it's not that they were too hot. It's just that I've ever had before. Much earlier!"
28873,99,5,11,"In 2030, Ted tells his children always to the history of the encounter with their mother."
28874,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): Children, in 2009, your Aunt Robin was the host of ""Welcome to New York."" And she was released early. How soon?"
28875,99,5,11,The cameraman sleeps standing before his camera.
28876,99,5,11,Robin: Mike? Wake up!
28877,99,5,11,Ted (2030): And then everything changed.
28878,99,5,11,Robin returned to the apartment where Ted played the console.
28879,99,5,11,Robin: Have you seen my show?
28880,99,5,11,"Ted: I wanted to watch it but I was too busy sleeping with this story. It took me all night, after 8 hours of the clock."
28881,99,5,11,"Robin: It's not serious, but listen to this! After the show..."
28882,99,5,11,Flashback
28883,99,5,11,"Robin at work, a man approaches her."
28884,99,5,11,Man: Are you Robin?
28885,99,5,11,Robin: Yes.
28886,99,5,11,"Man: I'm Don, your new co-presenter."
28887,99,5,11,Ted (2030): Don was Don Franck. A veteran of the morning shows... and a former host of 38 local programs across the country watched. This guy was a legend in the middle.
28888,99,5,11,End flashback
28889,99,5,11,"Ted: Wow, you're going you do too."
28890,99,5,11,"Robin: No, I just think it will be great both on the air."
28891,99,5,11,"Ted: And on the couch, the bed and on the coffee table."
28892,99,5,11,"Robin: Ok, ok, I'll go on the roof and stay there all alone 5 minutes."
28893,99,5,11,Ted: Have fun.
28894,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): And that's exactly what she did. She just stayed there. Okay kids, I'm a little liar with you. This is not what she did.That's what she did."
28895,99,5,11,"Robin: Okay, okay, I'll go smoke a cigarette."
28896,99,5,11,Children of Ted: What?
28897,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): I promised never to tell you. But occasionally, your Aunt Robin was enjoying a cigarette. And occasionally, the occasional cigarette. Was more than just casual."
28898,99,5,11,"Marshall, Barney and Ted entered the apartment while Robin does his gym."
28899,99,5,11,Barney: I just let something like that to my apartment.
28900,99,5,11,"Ted: Robin, going, going on the roof! We said no smoking in the apartment... after that you have set fire by the pumps."
28901,99,5,11,"Robin: Okay, very good, very good."
28902,99,5,11,"Marshall: Yeah Robin, I mean my God... not only is it a bad habit but... Do I have one?"
28903,99,5,11,Robin: Of course.
28904,99,5,11,Children of Ted: What?
28905,99,5,11,GENERIC
28906,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): Children, your Uncle Marshall would not like at all that you know that. But he also smoked from time to time."
28907,99,5,11,Flashback
28908,99,5,11,In 1991...
28909,99,5,11,Ted (2030): It started when he was 13. During an event camping in Minnesota.
28910,99,5,11,"Boy: Come on Marshall, it's Christmas! This holiday feast!"
28911,99,5,11,Marshall: But just one. This is the first and the last cigarette of my life.
28912,99,5,11,In 2006...
28913,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): And this was the first of many, many cigarettes last of his life."
28914,99,5,11,"Marshall: Okay, I'm done, I Quit!"
28915,99,5,11,In 2007 and 2008...
28916,99,5,11,Marshall:... last cigarette... my life.
28917,99,5,11,End flashback
28918,99,5,11,Ted (2030): And then what I had heard many times before.
28919,99,5,11,Marshall: last cigarette of my life.
28920,99,5,11,"Ted: What are you doing, you have not smoked in 6 months. Is it about ""MacGrib""? It closed guy, forget it."
28921,99,5,11,"Marshall: I'm worried about work, ok? They just hired a new chief legal department... and it will turn people."
28922,99,5,11,Ted: So that's why you're worried?
28923,99,5,11,Barney: The new head of legal department is Hobes Arthur.
28924,99,5,11,Ted: Is Arthur artillery? Your former leader.
28925,99,5,11,Ted (2030): Arthur Hobes is the worst leaders as Marshall or anyone have had. The last time Marshall had worked for him... it ended like that.
28926,99,5,11,Flashback
28927,99,5,11,Marshall: I quit!
28928,99,5,11,End flashback
28929,99,5,11,Ted: Is it always rebounded against you?
28930,99,5,11,Marshall: Worse!

28932,99,5,11,"Arthur: Sorry, who are you?"
28933,99,5,11,"Marshall: I have Marshall Eriksen. We had a pretty intense argument. As I've suggested that you take your head and you put yourself in the..., inside you. At a place that could reduce its exposure to the sun."
28934,99,5,11,"Arthur: Yeah, that describes 95% of my employees and my family. Except my dog. It's such a good boy. Well, I'll see you later... um Rendal Rilgurson."
28935,99,5,11,Marshall: Marshall Eriksen.

28937,99,5,11,End flashback
28938,99,5,11,"Ted: Wow, he not remember you."
28939,99,5,11,"Barney: Not great, it does not matter that Arthur Hobes not like Marshall, he loves no one. It is the people he knows that he has to separate. He just fired, ""What's his head? ""."
28940,99,5,11,"Marshall: It turned 'What is his head? ""Ted! And ""What's his head? ""Was priceless."
28941,99,5,11,"Ted: Look, I understand you to be upset but this is not a reason to kill you."
28942,99,5,11,"Barney: Yeah, after you turn'm doing... then you can kill you. As ""What is his head? "". Now I think it is, where is his head?"
28943,99,5,11,"Marshall: Look, it's just two cigarettes. Ok, I can collect 2. As it is not 3 within 24hrs I replongerai yet."
28944,99,5,11,Ted: What will Lily say when you learn that you smoked?
28945,99,5,11,Marshall: Lily did not discover. I have a system.
28946,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): Oh, yes, the system of Marshall."

And, she cut the cord with a metro ticket. We come back! And it's good!"
28957,99,5,11,"Robin: But what was that? Don, you said Pet brain!"
28958,99,5,11,"Don: Robin, you're a bit like a nice kid but this is my 39th local newspaper. And all this time I learned three things: prevention of all sushi restaurants at will before work. Do not go to the bathroom while you're still on the air. And 3: at this time, all your audience... it's a guy who is half drunk and in his underwear."
28959,99,5,11,Mike: Back in 5... 4...
28960,99,5,11,"Robin: Well, let a good program for what is half drunk."

28965,99,5,11,"Arthur: Oh, no! You're not here to jump, does not it? I have turned many people today... and I would not do another jump ruin my record. Oh, cigarettes?"
28966,99,5,11,"Marshall: No, no thank you!"
28967,99,5,11,Arthur: Too bad! Geoffrey you know why I miss? We used to smoke. People are now replaceable. But you share a cigarette with someone and you have a real link.
28968,99,5,11,Marshall: You know what? I'll take one.
28969,99,5,11,Arthur: Ok!
28970,99,5,11,"Marshall: Marshall I am aware. It was Marshall, Marshall Eriksen."
28971,99,5,11,Arthur: Tell me something Marshall Eriksen. Would you like to see a photo of the cutest dogs in the world? Good boy!
28972,99,5,11,Marshall and Lily goes home is on the couch to read.
28973,99,5,11,Marshall: Hey!
28974,99,5,11,Lily: You got smoked!
28975,99,5,11,"Marshall: Yes, I smoked! And it was my third day. You know what that means? I'm a smoker now. Everything is ruined. I bought a packet coming back, and a lighter... and a Viking lamp that has nothing to do, but I saw in the window and I liked it."
28976,99,5,11,Lily: Damn Marshall. It has four lamps and Viking smoking kills.
28977,99,5,11,"Marshall: It was to create a link with my boss, you should have seen me up there."
28978,99,5,11,Flashback
28979,99,5,11,Marshall: It's a beautiful dog. And it is your children?
28980,99,5,11,"Chief: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hey, hey, look what I got at the supermarket! (He shows his t-shirt under his shirt) he is! There he is! Go ahead, pet him now! Yeah, go! He loves it. Caress her chin!"
28981,99,5,11,End flashback
28982,99,5,11,"Lily: I do not care about your reasons, you know what I think of smoking. Now give me the cigarettes! And the lighter. (Lily lights a cigarette) Aaah, that thing!"
28983,99,5,11,Children of Ted: What!
28984,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): Oh yes, add your aunt Lily in the list! While your Uncle Marshall has relapsed, your aunt Lily has been trained with him."
28985,99,5,11,Robin is at work.
28986,99,5,11,Don: What are you doing?
28987,99,5,11,Robin: You should know that I tried to contact the town hall so we could get the mayor on the show.
28988,99,5,11,"Don: My God, you are adorable. The mayor does not come in emissions that no one is watching. My colonoscopy was more viewership. It was well twisted I admit."
28989,99,5,11,"Robin: I do not know why you act like that. Maybe you've never had a better job offer, but I still can, so I really want to focus."
28990,99,5,11,Don: I've already spent on the cable.
28991,99,5,11,Robin: You're already past the cable?
28992,99,5,11,"Don: It was the best weekend of my life. When you do the newspaper, you're sitting on ergonomic seats, you feel like sitting on a cloud, which was good also because it was just after my colonoscopy. And the locker room, wow."
28993,99,5,11,Mike: There are changing rooms?
28994,99,5,11,"Don: Oh yes there was the break, Mike. We will not change in the toilets of KFC on the other side of the street. Oh no. It was heaven. But once you get used to, they will not care at the door to find someone who is not undergoing divorce, or who is not addicted to gin. And before you know it, you find yourself in a dead end, surrounded by people who are going nowhere in their careers, making these programs in their underwear."
28995,99,5,11,"Robin: ok, the trick underwear was your choice. And I would not keep that going."
28996,99,5,11,Don: You are beautiful guys. It's comfortable eh?
28997,99,5,11,
28998,99,5,11,"Lily, Marshall and Robin were in the street and smoke."
28999,99,5,11,"Robin: I want to kill him, of course people watching this show.You look at her. My God, you still have not seen the program."
29000,99,5,11,Lily: We saw.
29001,99,5,11,Robin: Really? What color is the decor?
29002,99,5,11,"Marshall: It's black, or silver."
29003,99,5,11,"Robin: Not your TV, the decor of my show. If my best friends do not watch, will watch it..."
29004,99,5,11,"Marshall: A lot of people... Bedrin the insomniac, who portrays Blongs front of department stores. People to the emergency room where the TV is in a cage, and you can not change channels."
29005,99,5,11,Robin: You have film crews?
29006,99,5,11,Ted is with McLaren's Barney.
29007,99,5,11,"Ted: I can not believe they're smoking outside, it's really cold."
29008,99,5,11,Barney: Do you remember when you could smoke in bars?
29009,99,5,11,Flashback
29010,99,5,11,The bar is filled with smoke.
29011,99,5,11,Ted: I think there's a pretty girl smiling at me there.
29012,99,5,11,"Barney: Hey, this is a chair, but go ahead and drag it."
29013,99,5,11,Ted: Guys?
29014,99,5,11,Marshall: Marco?
29015,99,5,11,Ted and Barney: Polo!
29016,99,5,11,End flashback
29017,99,5,11,"Ted: Our group is divided into smokers and nonsmokers, and it's great."
29018,99,5,11,Barney: You're right. Going for a smoke.
29019,99,5,11,Children of Ted: What?
29020,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): Yes, I'm not proud."
29021,99,5,11,"Robin: Hey you two, smoking, like us."
29022,99,5,11,"Barney: I'm not a smoker. I do not smoke on certain occasions.After s*x, when I'm with German, sometimes both at the same time. During s*x, for birthdays, to annoy my mother, just before s*x, on a sailboat. The day the mentor MC mailly eliminated each year, and of course... wait, because God knows it's true: fear of pregnancy."
29023,99,5,11,Ted: And why you smoke there?
29024,99,5,11,Barney: I'm always on the verge of sleep Ted.
29025,99,5,11,"Lily: Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors."
29026,99,5,11,Barney: And my abs muscle nicotine. I... am... muscular.
29027,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): As glamorous as it might be, we all cracked after one week."
29028,99,5,11,Marshall and Lily sleeps coughing.
29029,99,5,11,"Marshall: It's alright, darling?"
29030,99,5,11,"Lily, with a deep voice: Actually, my throat is a little dry."
29031,99,5,11,"Ted climbs stairs and three packets later, he is totally out of breath. Barney discovers a cigarette hole in his tie."
29032,99,5,11,Marshall and on the roof with his boss.
29033,99,5,11,"Arthur: So I teased him a little with the newspaper like that, and my wife said, you can not treat your son as well. Michael calls for help."
29034,99,5,11,It falls on the roof.
29035,99,5,11,"Marshall: Yes, right away, and me is Marshall."
29036,99,5,11,"Ted, Barney, Lily and Marshall are on the roof of the apartment to smoke."
29037,99,5,11,"Barney: My God, I hope that Arthur is well. I reserve her office in case."
29038,99,5,11,Ted: We must stop smoking.
29039,99,5,11,"Lily, with a deep voice: Baby, you said it was going."
29040,99,5,11,"Marshall: I would never have started. I finally revisit in 13 years, if I could go back. (Young Marshall went camping with a buddy and they smoke. Older Marshall arrives and pat the hand of young Marshall to drop the cigarette. It gives him a punch in the stomach) I hate that little b*st*rd."
29041,99,5,11,Lily: Me too.
29042,99,5,11,"Ted: Ok it's good, we stop."
29043,99,5,11,"Marshall: Yes, we stop."
29044,99,5,11,"Marshall, Lily and Ted put out the cigarette. Only Barney keeps his."
29045,99,5,11,"Barney: I'm proud of you guys. I heard how it was difficult to stop smoking for as you, then the part of non-smokers, I tell you hat, so give me your cigarettes and I rid, one at a time."
29046,99,5,11,"Lily: You stop my chick. (She removes the cigarette from his hands) I know I did not call you chick normally, but it does with that voice. Chick."
29047,99,5,11,"Robin: Guys, I wonder, you also are interviewing the mayor tomorrow, or it just me? Don was in the teeth, while I'm smoking a. Lighter Marshall."
29048,99,5,11,"Marshall: Actually, we all decided to stop."
29049,99,5,11,"Robin: Fantastic, I was fed up that you piquiez me my smokes constantly."
29050,99,5,11,"Ted: Robin, we must do together."
29051,99,5,11,Robin: No.
29052,99,5,11,Lily: You can sleep with Marshall.
29053,99,5,11,"Marshall: Lily God, no."
29054,99,5,11,"Lily: Sorry darling, that's for the team."
29055,99,5,11,Robin: I do not want to have s*x with Marshall.
29056,99,5,11,Marshall: Sure.
29057,99,5,11,"Robin: I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful."
29058,99,5,11,Barney: It's too stressful!
29059,99,5,11,Marshall: Just one.
29060,99,5,11,Lily: Give a cigarette!
29061,99,5,11,"Ted: Damn Robin, think about it a moment, Blue Bug is the mayor anti cigarette. You really want to go to the interview smelling cigarettes? It's like interviewing a feeling the vegetarian steak."
29062,99,5,11,"Marshall: Really, it's hard enough like that?"
29063,99,5,11,Ted: You stop! It all stops.
29064,99,5,11,"Robin: Ok, I stop."
29065,99,5,11,Ted: We should just spend the first 24 hours after a piece of cake.
29066,99,5,11,"26 hours later... Lily, Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar and the table is filled with food."
29067,99,5,11,Lily: Barney stops eating your fingers.
29068,99,5,11,"Barney: I do not bite my nails, I try to suck the rest of nicotine on my fingers."
29069,99,5,11,Ted: Marshall pass me your plate.
29070,99,5,11,"Marshall: What, you're a dinosaur?"
29071,99,5,11,Barney: What do cigarettes now? You believe they think of us?
29072,99,5,11,"Ted: Dude, if you do not stop moving your feet, I'll tear it off."
29073,99,5,11,"Marshall: Oh Ted, I'm sorry, maybe I should move closer to your ass!"
29074,99,5,11,Ted: Ok we'll do it now!
29075,99,5,11,Ted (2030): Nobody knew why we fight. We just knew we wanted to smoke more than anything. It was not great for Robin either.
29076,99,5,11,"Don, who arrive without pants: Sorry I'm late. Someone used the microwave, and I got stuck in the elevator. What are you doing?"
29077,99,5,11,"Robin Don, seriously, not tonight. I'm on my nerves, because I had quit smoking for the interview the mayor."
29078,99,5,11,"Don: Oh my little princess porcelain, why would you do that?"
29079,99,5,11,"Robin: Why? Because it is important to Don, the issue is important and my career. Not like you, you incompetent. You're boring, you are bad, and I want you to work at least as hard as the elastic of your underwear."
29080,99,5,11,Don: I begin to believe that it becomes personal.
29081,99,5,11,"Robin: No gift, it would become personal if I told you that just because you pass emission issue, it's because you're losing. A loser lazy and obnoxious."
29082,99,5,11,Don: The mayor canceled.
29083,99,5,11,Mike: 5... 4... 3... 2...
29084,99,5,11,"Robin: Hello, this is Robin Scherbatsky."
29085,99,5,11,"Don: You think I'm a loser? You're right, I'm a but at least I accept it."
29086,99,5,11,Robin: A raccoon has bitten a patient in a nursing home.
29087,99,5,11,"Don: I was like you at first, I always wanted more, and I had nothing. This is a dead Robin, you'll never be a superstar of television. Since you never stop smoking."
29088,99,5,11,Robin: What are you doing?
29089,99,5,11,Don: I like my cigarette. Oh that's good. Want a latte?
29090,99,5,11,Robin: You can be professional?
29091,99,5,11,"Don: Yes professional, you know who holds the camera? A chair, even the cameraman is not looking our show and that's why the mayor has canceled. And Mike went to fast food, and that you and I can enjoy a cigarette here."
29092,99,5,11,Robin: No thank you.
29093,99,5,11,"Don: Why? Because there are millions of viewers? If viewers are problems with this, call us at the number on the screen: 212-555-0192. Go robin, appreciate life a little. (She takes the cigarette when the phone rings) It must be Mike, he always forgets to take them into extra-crunchy."
29094,99,5,11,"Marshall: Robin, do not smoke this cigarette."
29095,99,5,11,Robin: Marshall?
29096,99,5,11,"Marshall: They look at you all, we are all impressed and if you smoke this cigarette, we shall return it to us too."
29097,99,5,11,Robin: You watch the show?
29098,99,5,11,"Lily: Yes sweetie, and you are very pretty."
29099,99,5,11,Robin: Oh guys.
29100,99,5,11,"Ted: You do not have to do that, you do not need to smoke."
29101,99,5,11,Lily: Resists sweetie!
29102,99,5,11,Robin: Thanks for calling friends.
29103,99,5,11,She puts the cigarette in the cup of Don and it ignites.
29104,99,5,11,Marshall: She did!
29105,99,5,11,Ted: Good for her.
29106,99,5,11,Lily: We will not smoke.
29107,99,5,11,Barney: I have a hiding on the roof.
29108,99,5,11,They get up and go on the roof. Robin arrives.
29109,99,5,11,"Barney: Oh, I woke up and I smoke. Robin, you know how it's dangerous to wake a smoker sleeps."
29110,99,5,11,Robin: I bought a packet on the way home.
29111,99,5,11,Marshall: Robin Good show.
29112,99,5,11,Lily: And this guy So what con.
29113,99,5,11,Robin: He ended up apologizing.
29114,99,5,11,"Lily: When he got up, the forms were more revealing, you should go out with him."
29115,99,5,11,Robin: We believe in it all.
29116,99,5,11,Ted (2030): They went out together three months later. But we will come back.
29117,99,5,11,"Ted: Well look, the sun rises."
29118,99,5,11,Robin: You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last.
29119,99,5,11,"Barney: Come on, let's do it."
29120,99,5,11,Marshall: The last three.
29121,99,5,11,Ted: A...
29122,99,5,11,Lily:... two...
29123,99,5,11,Robin:... three.
29124,99,5,11,"Ted (2030): We all stopped for a while after that. But this was not the last, even though we ended up really stop. Robin was arrested in June 2013. Barney in March 2017. Lily stopped from the moment she wanted to get pregnant. Marshall stopped when it was Dad. And my last two weeks before I met your mother, and I did most affected."
29125,99,5,11,Marshall will see Marshall in his young day camping with her boyfriend. Buddy runs away when he saw Marshall get older.
29126,99,5,11,Marshall: Sorry to have hit my friend. I want to redeem myself by giving you this.
29127,99,5,11,"Young Marshall: Wow, she's pretty."
29128,99,5,11,Marshall: Well one day you will marry her.
29129,99,5,11,Marshall Young: For real?
29130,99,5,11,"Marshall: Yes, lucky."
29131,99,5,11,Marshall Young: Bluntly. I'll be in my tent.
29132,99,5,11,"Marshall: Oh no, no do not do that. Have fun for me."
29133,100,5,12,"In 2030, Ted tells his children the story of the encounter with their mother."
29134,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): Children, you never know when you will meet someone important. It's not as if life warned you. You look, and they are there."
29135,100,5,12,"Ted comes out of his classroom and in the corridors, he sees a group of young people with packs of beer."
29136,100,5,12,"Student: Come on, let's go get stoned on the roof."
29137,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): No, not this guy. It."
29138,100,5,12,"Student: Do not bother, Boomer."
29139,100,5,12,Student: I do not call me Boomer.
29140,100,5,12,"Student: For me, this is your name."
29141,100,5,12,"Ted: Gentlemen, I am a professor at this university and you are minor, so it is my duty to confiscate it, and that, and... the cooler?You know what, Boomer? You can keep it."
29142,100,5,12,Ted returned to his classroom with a student.
29143,100,5,12,"Student: Each week, a guy in a fraternity invites me to a party and I said ""I am preparing my PhD and I write a thesis which is entitled Foreign Direct Investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. """
29144,100,5,12,Ted: And they will respond?
29145,100,5,12,"Student: ""It's sexy. """
29146,100,5,12,"Ted: Actually, it's really sexy."
29147,100,5,12,Student: I have a confession to make. I recognize you. Do you remember the first day of last semester? Advanced Eco?
29148,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): Children, do you remember the history of bad amphitheater."
29149,100,5,12,Flashback
29150,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): I thought I was in architecture intro, I was in advanced eco. Of course, I did not know that your mother was in the auditorium, and she took me for an idiot."
29151,100,5,12,End flashback
29152,100,5,12,Student: I took you for an idiot. But a very cute idiot.
29153,100,5,12,Ted: You go out with idiots cute?
29154,100,5,12,Student: Almost all the time.
29155,100,5,12,GENERIC
29156,100,5,12,"Ted is in his apartment with Robin, Barney and Lily."
29157,100,5,12,"Ted: She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times."
29158,100,5,12,"Barney: Ted, I am happy for you. Sorry, not for you, not to be you."
29159,100,5,12,"Ted: To summarize, I have a date tonight. (We hear screaming outside) Thank you, New York! I try not to screw up."
29160,100,5,12,Lily: What's going on? There are queuing outside the McLaren's.
29161,100,5,12,Robin: Why it's almost that guys?
29162,100,5,12,Barney: Only two things can cause this turmoil.
29163,100,5,12,"Ted, Robin, Lily and Barney are down at the bar where all the guys at the counter."
29164,100,5,12,"Barney: Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid."
29165,100,5,12,Lily: Look at all these guys. The sidewalk will feel the pee now.
29166,100,5,12,Robin: We'd better find a new bar.
29167,100,5,12,"Barney: What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge..."
29168,100,5,12,Robin: Abbreviates!
29169,100,5,12,"Barney: I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight."
29170,100,5,12,Robin: It's not so sexy.
29171,100,5,12,Ted: Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?
29172,100,5,12,Robin: No. Shut up!
29173,100,5,12,Barney: Wish me luck.
29174,100,5,12,Lily: It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.
29175,100,5,12,"Barney: Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him ""Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. ""And when she will, I recracherai saying"" Do it again. "" The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?"
29176,100,5,12,Marshall arrives.
29177,100,5,12,"Marshall: Guys, what's up?"
29178,100,5,12,Lily: A new super sexy barmaid.
29179,100,5,12,Robin: You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.
29180,100,5,12,Lily: If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good.
29181,100,5,12,"Marshall: I know, and if this woman was almost as sexy as mine, so I admit, but it is not the case."
29182,100,5,12,"Lily: Baby, you're an angel, but compared to this woman, I am a big trash bag 3 days."
29183,100,5,12,"Marshall: I say what I see, and... I think until you're the most beautiful woman in the world."
29184,100,5,12,"Lily: You see, it's really annoying."
29185,100,5,12,Barmaid: You're so funny. It'll be $ 6.75.
29186,100,5,12,"Man: There's, 50, keep the change."
29187,100,5,12,Barmaid: Thank you.
29188,100,5,12,Barney: Amateurs.
29189,100,5,12,Barmaid: What do you want?
29190,100,5,12,"Barney: Do not even try, baby. Wait, what?"
29191,100,5,12,Barmaid: You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?
29192,100,5,12,Barney: Uh...
29193,100,5,12,Barmaid: I do not know a Heu. It's half vodka and half-bar of yourself then?
29194,100,5,12,Ted (2030): That night I went to a very important first date.
29195,100,5,12,Ted is in the student with whom he spoke earlier.
29196,100,5,12,Ted: How are you?
29197,100,5,12,Student: Okay. Between.
29198,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): It's funny, sometimes you walk into an apartment for the first time, but it was the feeling of being right where it should be. And children, it was the first time I saw the little yellow bus of your mother. You know him. It is right behind you."
29199,100,5,12,Ted: It's cute.
29200,100,5,12,"Student: Actually, this is my roommate."
29201,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): And so I was there in the apartment of your mother, except that I was dating her roommate, Cindy."
29202,100,5,12,"Ted: Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like?"
29203,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): I do not know, but I would hear the first description of the woman I would marry."
29204,100,5,12,Cindy: That is a whore. I think this is a dominatrix.
29205,100,5,12,Ted: What?
29206,100,5,12,"Cindy: Okay, sorry, this is not true. I have a roommate complex."
29207,100,5,12,Ted: Why?
29208,100,5,12,Cindy: The guys always fall in love with her.
29209,100,5,12,"Ted: Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate."
29210,100,5,12,Ted (2030): Oops!
29211,100,5,12,"At the bar, Marshall brings beers."
29212,100,5,12,"Lily: Now that you have been looking more closely, admit it: the bartender is the sexiest of the Bar."
29213,100,5,12,Robin: The second sexiest.
29214,100,5,12,Marshall: I repeat...
29215,100,5,12,"Lily: Baby, how can you not want you to do? I want to do it. If you do not wanna do it, sorry, but you must be gay."
29216,100,5,12,"Marshall: Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you."
29217,100,5,12,Barney: No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?
29218,100,5,12,Marshall: Yes... You will not like the answer.
29219,100,5,12,Flashback
29220,100,5,12,2 minutes ago...
29221,100,5,12,Barmaid: My last three were former Wall Street brokers.Bastards. I swore never to go out with a guy who wears suits.
29222,100,5,12,End flashback
29223,100,5,12,Barney: It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.
29224,100,5,12,"Robin: Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume."
29225,100,5,12,"Summer 2009, Barney skied in costume."
29226,100,5,12,"Barney: True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait..."
29227,100,5,12,"Robin: We know you're gonna say ""costumes""."
29228,100,5,12,Barney costumes.
29229,100,5,12,Ted and Cindy are in the restaurant.
29230,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): Meanwhile, Cindy and I spent a pleasant evening, but she was not kidding about his roommate complex."
29231,100,5,12,Cindy: Another weird thing on my roommate: she paints robots who play sports.
29232,100,5,12,Ted: It's strange.
29233,100,5,12,Ted (2030): I lied. It looked great. The watercolor of the robot playing volleyball with your mother is still in remission.
29234,100,5,12,Cindy: And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf.
29235,100,5,12,Ted: It's weird.
29236,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): The version of ""Memories"" of your mother, sung by an English muffin, is to date the most beautiful thing I've heard in my life."
29237,100,5,12,"Ted: Look, I am defeated. I hate it."
29238,100,5,12,Cindy: Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous.
29239,100,5,12,Ted: I do not know why. You're great.
29240,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): But not as much as your mother. And speaking of things that are less brilliant, your uncle Barney was formally arrested costumes."
29241,100,5,12,
29242,100,5,12,"Barney is at McLaren's, in jeans and T-shirt."
29243,100,5,12,"Barmaid: Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply."
29244,100,5,12,Barney: The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them.
29245,100,5,12,"Ted joined Robin, Lily and Marshall sitting at their usual table."
29246,100,5,12,"Robin: So, your date with Cindy?"
29247,100,5,12,"Ted: Well, last night, it was nice today, less."
29248,100,5,12,Lily: Why?
29249,100,5,12,Flashback
29250,100,5,12,At the University...
29251,100,5,12,Cindy: I discovered that the settlement on all outgoing students and teachers are very strict. I could lose my scholarship.
29252,100,5,12,Ted: It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department.
29253,100,5,12,"Cindy: Sorry, but I can not take that risk."
29254,100,5,12,End flashback
29255,100,5,12,"Ted: She exaggerates, there, right?"
29256,100,5,12,"Robin: Well, Ted, she's right."
29257,100,5,12,"Lily: And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in."
29258,100,5,12,"Marshall: I think you should leave it, buddy."
29259,100,5,12,"Ted: Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?"
29260,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy."
29261,100,5,12,Barney is looking for clothes in her wardrobe.
29262,100,5,12,Barney conscience: In costume.
29263,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): None of us had seen for so long without Barney costume, and children, it was not pretty."
29264,100,5,12,"Marshall joined the others at the bar, in costume."
29265,100,5,12,Marshall: Sorry for my delay. I was stuck at work. I had this presentation on taxes on dividends.
29266,100,5,12,"Lily: Of course, I listened carefully when you spoke."
29267,100,5,12,"Marshall: So, I started the Powerpoint... (rubs Barney costume at Marshall) Barney?"
29268,100,5,12,Barney locks himself in the bathroom where he finds a suit.
29269,100,5,12,Barney conscience: In costume.
29270,100,5,12,He finds himself in a suit when Marshall picks him.
29271,100,5,12,Marshall: We will order food.
29272,100,5,12,Barney: I arrive in a second.
29273,100,5,12,Marshall and Barney restarts off his costume. He cracked his suit jacket.
29274,100,5,12,"Barney, running down the street: Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time."
29275,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): If someone could fix such a thing, it was the tailor personnel Barney, TV's Tim Gunn."
29276,100,5,12,Barney is his tailor.
29277,100,5,12,"Tim: Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do."
29278,100,5,12,Barney: So young. You can not do anything else?
29279,100,5,12,Tim: No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.
29280,100,5,12,Barney: It can... As an organ donor?
29281,100,5,12,Tim: The death of this suit could save the life of another.
29282,100,5,12,Barney: But I... Do it.
29283,100,5,12,Tim: You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.
29284,100,5,12,Barney: Sorry. I know. I know.
29285,100,5,12,"Barney joined Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin at the bar, with an urn in his hands."
29286,100,5,12,Barney: We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.
29287,100,5,12,"Robin: Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid."
29288,100,5,12,"Barney: No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine."
29289,100,5,12,Ted: There is absolutely right.
29290,100,5,12,"Lily: Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?"
29291,100,5,12,"Ted: What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Barney before leaving) I do not know why I did that."
29292,100,5,12,"Barmaid: Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him."
29293,100,5,12,"Barney: It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no."
29294,100,5,12,Barmaid: How old was he?
29295,100,5,12,Barney: 7 years. I miss him so much!
29296,100,5,12,Barmaid: You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.
29297,100,5,12,"Barney: Thank you, old friend. You go on a good shot."
29298,100,5,12,Barney share with the barmaid.
29299,100,5,12,"Lily: Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me."
29300,100,5,12,Marshall: I can not. You're sexier than she.
29301,100,5,12,"Lily: That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once."
29302,100,5,12,"Marshall: What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?"
29303,100,5,12,Lily: I never said that.
29304,100,5,12,Marshall: You think so!
29305,100,5,12,Lily: It's not comparable. She is younger than you.
29306,100,5,12,"Marshall: I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old."
29307,100,5,12,"Robin: You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look."
29308,100,5,12,Robin takes off his jacket and goes behind the counter.
29309,100,5,12,Marshall: I guess you also think she is sexier than me.
29310,100,5,12,Carl: What are you doing?
29311,100,5,12,Robin: What?
29312,100,5,12,Carl: You do not have the right to be there.
29313,100,5,12,"Robin: Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave."
29314,100,5,12,Carl: You have to go. You have to go.
29315,100,5,12,"Robin: I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me."
29316,100,5,12,Ted walking in the rain. A knock at Cindy.
29317,100,5,12,Ted: Can we talk?
29318,100,5,12,Cindy: My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.
29319,100,5,12,"Ted: I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says ""Do not teach in having drunk"" and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you."
29320,100,5,12,"Cindy: I do not want it, me either."
29321,100,5,12,"Ted: I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common."
29322,100,5,12,Cindy: Really?
29323,100,5,12,Ted: The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.
29324,100,5,12,Cindy: This is my roommate. I borrowed.
29325,100,5,12,Ted: And that? After World T.C Boyle?
29326,100,5,12,Cindy: Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.
29327,100,5,12,"Ted: You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate."
29328,100,5,12,Cindy: It is in a group.
29329,100,5,12,"Ted: Damn, that's cool."
29330,100,5,12,Cindy: It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.
29331,100,5,12,Ted: The group played shows your roommate or...?
29332,100,5,12,Cindy: Get out.
29333,100,5,12,"Ted (2030): Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella."
29334,100,5,12,Barney the bartender back home.
29335,100,5,12,"Barney: It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting."
29336,100,5,12,Barmaid: I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.
29337,100,5,12,"Barney: Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is..."
29338,100,5,12,Barmaid: They are yours?
29339,100,5,12,Barney: I'm the suit-sitting for someone.
29340,100,5,12,"Barmaid: Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes."
29341,100,5,12,The barmaid hand.
29342,100,5,12,"Barney, singing and dancing in the street: I know what you're thinking, ""What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! ""I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis."
29343,100,5,12,"Marshall, doing the same: Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?"
29344,100,5,12,Barney: Costumes!
29345,100,5,12,"Marshall: What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?"
29346,100,5,12,Barney: Costumes!
29347,100,5,12,Robin: What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?
29348,100,5,12,Barney: Do we see.
29349,100,5,12,Lily: And a world at peace would be within your reach?
29350,100,5,12,"Barney: I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume..."
29351,100,5,12,"Ted, Marshall, Lily: Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!"
29352,100,5,12,"Barney: Mind you, it is rather barrel. (Back at Barney) I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes."
29353,100,5,12,Barmaid: Really?
29354,100,5,12,Barney: Yeah. (They kiss) I will do you nothing!
